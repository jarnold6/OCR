<title>FIRST NOTEBOOK</title>
<p align="left">I'<emph type="6">M</emph> not Stiller!&#x2014;Day after day, ever since <emph type="6">I</emph> was put into this prison, which I shall describe in a minute, I have been saying it, swearing it, asking for whisky, and refusing to make any other statement. For experience has taught me that without whisky I'm not myself, I'm open to all sorts of good influences and liable to play the part they want me to play, although it's not me at all. But since the only thing that matters in my crazy situation (they think I'm a missing resident of their little town) is to refuse to be wheedled and to guard against all their well-meaning attempts to shove me into somebody else's skin, to resist their blandishments even if it means being downright rude&#x2014;in a word, to be no one else than the man I unfortunately really am&#x2014;I shall go on shouting for whisky the moment anyone comes near my cell. I told them several days ago it needn't be the very best brand, but it must be drinkable, otherwise I shall remain sober; then they can question me as much as they like, they won't get anything out of me&#x2014;or at any rate, nothing that's true. In vain. Today they brought me this notebook full of empty pages. I'm supposed to write down my life story&#x2014;no doubt to prove I have one, a different one from the life of their missing Herr Stiller.</p>
<p>'Just write the truth,' said the defence counsel provided for me by the State, 'nothing but the plain, unvarnished truth. They'll fill your pen for you whenever you want.'</p>
<break type="graphic"/>
<p align="left">It's a week today since the clip on the ear that led to my arrest. According to the evidence I was rather drunk; I therefore find it difficult to describe the (outward) course of events.</p>
<p>'Come with me,' said the customs officer.</p>
<p>'Please don't make difficulties,' I said. 'My train will be leaving any minute.'</p>
<p>'But without you,' said the customs officer.</p>
<p>The way he pulled me off the footboard deprived me of any wish to answer his questions. He had my passport in his hand. <!--leaf009:

<p>'Is there something wrong with my passport?' I asked.</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>'I'm only doing my duty,' he said several times. 'You know that very well.'</p>
<p>Without answering my question as to what was wrong with the passport&#x2014;an American passport, with which I had been half-way round the world!&#x2014;he repeated in his Swiss intonation:</p>
<p>'Come with me.'</p>
<p>'Now look, officer,' I said, 'if you don't want a clip on the ear, please don't pull me by the sleeve; I can't stand it.'</p>
<p>'Come along now.'</p>
<p>I boxed the young customs officer's ear just as he was telling me, in spite of my polite but unambiguous warning and with the arrogant air of one protected by the Law, that they would soon let me know who I really was. His navy blue cap rolled along the platform in a spiral, and for an instant the young customs officer, now capless and consequently much more human, was so flabbergasted&#x2014;too much taken aback even to be angry&#x2014;that I could easily have got into the train. It was just beginning to move off, people were leaning out of the windows waving, and one carriage door was still open. I don't know why I didn't jump in. I believe I could have snatched my passport, for, as I have said, the young man was completely dumbfounded, as though his whole soul was in the rolling cap; and it was not until the stiff cap had stopped rolling that he was seized with understandable rage. I ducked down among the people, determined at least to brush some of the dust off his navy blue cap with its Swiss cross badge before handing it back to him. His ears were lobster red. It was strange: I followed him as though under some compulsion to behave myself. He didn't say a word and without taking hold of me, which was quite unnecessary, led me to the police station, where I was kept waiting for fifty minutes.</p>
<p>'Please sit down,' said the Inspector.</p>
<p>The passport lay on the table. I was immediately struck by the changed tone in which I was addressed, a kind of solicitous and rather clumsy politeness, from which I gathered that after <!--leaf010:

<p>'You speak German, I hear,' he remarked.</p>
<p>'Why not?' I asked.</p>
<p>'Do sit down,' he smiled.</p>
<p>I remained standing.</p>
<p>'I'm of German origin,' I explained, 'an American of German origin&#x2014;'</p>
<p>He pointed to the empty armchair.</p>
<p>'Please,' he said, and hesitated for a while to sit down himself... If I had not condescended to speak German in the train I might never have found myself in this scrape. Another passenger, a Swiss, had spoken to me in German. The same traveller, who had been getting on my nerves ever since we left Paris, was also an eye-witness of the blow I gave the customs officer. I didn't know who he was. I'd never seen him before. He got into the compartment in Paris, woke me up by stumbling over my feet, forced his way to the open window with apologies in French, and there said good-bye to a lady, speaking in Swiss dialect. No sooner had the train started than I had the disagreeable sensation that he was staring at me. I took refuge behind my <emph type="2">New Yorker,</emph> whose jokes I already knew by heart, in the hope that my travelling companion's curiosity would eventually be exhausted. He was also reading a paper, a Zurich paper. After we had agreed in French to close the window, I avoided every unnecessary glance at the passing landscape; meanwhile my unknown companion, who may have been a charming fellow for all I know, was so obviously waiting on tenterhooks for an opportunity to start a conversation that finally there was nothing for it but the dining-car, where I sat for five hours and had a drink or two. I didn't return to the compartment until compelled to by the approach of the frontier between Mulhouse and Basle. Again the Swiss looked at me as though he knew me. I don't know what it was that suddenly encouraged him to speak to me; possibly the mere fact that we were now on his native soil. 'Excuse me,' he asked in a rather embarrassed manner, 'aren't you Herr Stiller?'</p>

<p>As I have mentioned, I had drunk a certain amount of whisky, I couldn't make out what he was saying. I held my American passport in my hand, while the Swiss, relapsing into his dialect, turned the pages of an illustrated paper. A couple of officials were already standing behind us, a customs officer and another man holding a rubber stamp. I handed over my passport. I now realized that I had drunk a lot and was being looked at with suspicion. My luggage, of which I had little, was in order.</p>
<p>'Is that your passport?' asked the other man.</p>
<p>At first I laughed, of course. 'Why shouldn't it be?' I asked, and added indignantly: 'What's wrong with my passport?' It was the first time doubt had been cast on my passport, and all because this gentleman had confused me with a picture in his illustrated paper...</p>
<p>'Herr Doktor,' said the Inspector to this same gentleman, 'I needn't detain you further. Many thanks for your information.'</p>
<p>As the grateful Inspector held the door open for him, the gentleman nodded to me as though we knew each other. He was a Herr Doktor; there are thousands of them. I didn't feel the slightest desire to nod to him. Then the Inspector came back and pointed to the chair again.</p>
<p>'Do take a seat. As I can see Herr Stiller, you're pretty drunk&#x2014;'</p>
<p>'Stiller?' I said. 'My name's not Stiller.'</p>
<p>'I hope,' he went on unperturbed, 'you can nevertheless understand what I have to say to you, Herr Stiller.'</p>
<p>I shook my head, whereupon he offered me a smoke, a Swiss cigar. I naturally refused it, since it was obviously offered not to me, but to a certain Herr Stiller. I also remained standing, although the Inspector had settled down in his chair as though for a long chat.</p>
<p>'Why did you get so excited when you were asked whether it was your proper passport?' he asked.</p>
<p>He turned the pages of my American passport.</p>
<p>'Look Inspector,' I said, 'I can't stand being taken by the sleeve. I warned your young customs officer several times. I'm sorry I lost my temper and hit him, and of course, I'll pay the usual fine at once. That goes without saying. What's the damage?'</p>

<p>He smiled indulgently. It wasn't quite as simple as that, he told me. Then he lit a cigar, carefully, rolling the brown stump between his lips, leisurely, thoroughly, as though time was no object.</p>
<p>'You seem to be an extremely well-known man&#x2014;'</p>
<p>'I?' I asked. 'What makes you think that?'</p>
<p>'I don't know anything about these things,' he said, 'but this Herr Doktor, who recognized you, seems to have a very high opinion of you.'</p>
<p>There was nothing to be done. The confusion had arisen, and whatever I said was taken as affectation or genuine modesty.</p>
<p>'Why do you call yourself Sam White?' he asked.</p>
<p>I talked and talked.</p>
<p>'Where did you get this passport?' he asked.</p>
<p>He took it almost good-naturedly and sat back smoking his rather evil-smelling cigar, his thumbs hooked in his braces, for it was a hot afternoon, so that the Inspector, especially as he no longer considered me a foreigner, had undone some of the buttons of his not very suitable jacket, while he gazed at me without listening to a word I was saying.</p>
<p>'Inspector,' I said. 'I'm drunk, you're right, perfectly right, but I'm not going to have some wretched Herr Doktor&#x2014;'</p>
<p>'He says he knows you.'</p>
<p>'Where from?' I asked.</p>
<p>'From the illustrated paper,' he said and took advantage of my contemptuous silence to add: 'You have a wife living in Paris. Is that right?'</p>
<p>'I? A wife?'</p>
<p>'Julika by name.'</p>
<p>'I don't come from Paris,' I declared. 'I come from Mexico, Inspector.'</p>
<p>I gave him the name of the ship, the duration of the crossing, the time of my arrival at Le Havre, the time of my departure from Vera Cruz.</p>
<p>'That may be,' he said, 'but your wife lives in Paris. A dancer, if I'm not mistaken. She's supposed to be an extremely beautiful woman.'</p>
<p>I said nothing.</p>

But now she runs a ballet school in Paris. Right? For the last six years.'</p>
<p>I only looked at him.</p>
<p>'Since your disappearance.'</p>
<p>I had involuntarily sat down to hear what the readers of an illustrated paper knew about someone who obviously, at least in the eyes of a Herr Doktor, resembled me; I took out a cigarette, whereupon the Inspector, already infected by the esteem spread by this same Herr Doktor, gave me a light.</p>
<p>'So you yourself are a sculptor.'</p>
<p>I laughed.</p>
<p>'Is that right?' he asked without waiting for an answer, and immediately proceeded to the next question: 'Why are you travelling under an assumed name?'</p>
<p>He did not believe my oath either.</p>
<p>'I'm sorry,' he said hunting through a drawer, from which he pulled out a blue form. 'I'm sorry, Herr Stiller, but if you continue to refuse to show your proper passport I shall have to hand you over to the C.I.D. Make no mistake about that.'</p>
<p>Then he tapped the ash from his cigar.</p>
<p>'I'm not Stiller,' I reiterated, as he began conscientiously to fill in the voluminous form, but it was as though he simply didn't hear me any more. I tried a different tone of voice. I spoke solemnly and soberly: 'Inspector, I haven't got another passport.' Or with a laugh: 'That's a lot of nonsense.' But in spite of my drunkenness I could clearly feel that the more I spoke, the less he listened. Finally I shouted: 'I'm not Stiller, devil take it.' I yelled and banged my fist on the table.</p>
<p>'Why get so excited?'</p>
<p>'Inspector,' I said, 'give me my passport.'</p>
<p>He didn't even look up.</p>
<p>'You're under arrest,' he said, turning the pages of my passport with his left hand, copying down the number, the date of issue, the name of the American consul in Mexico, everything the blue form demanded in such cases, and said in a not unfriendly voice: 'Sit down.'</p>

No more and no less. Everything in this country is oppressively adequate. The cell is 10 feet long, 7 feet 10 inches wide, and 8 feet 3 inches high. A humane prison, there's no denying it, and that's what makes it so unbearable. Not a cobweb, not a. trace of mildew on the walls, nothing to justify indignation. Some prisons get stormed when the people learn about them; here there's nothing to storm. Millions of people, I know, live worse than I do. The bed has springs. The barred window lets in the sun&#x2014;at this time of the year until about eleven a.m. The table has two drawers and there is also a Bible and a standard lamp. And when I have to do my business I only have to press a white button and I am taken to the appropriate place, which is not supplied with old newspapers one can first read, but with soft crepe paper. And yet it's a prison, and there are moments when you feel like screaming. You don't do so, any more than in a big store; you dry your hands on a towel, walk on linoleum, and say thank you when you're locked into your cabin again. Apart from the already autumnal foliage of a chestnut tree I can see nothing, not even if I climb up on the sprung bed, which incidentally (with shoes) is forbidden. Sounds of unknown origin are the worst torment, of course. Since I discovered they still have trams in this town I have almost been able to ignore their rumbling. But the unintelligible announcer on a nearby radio, the daily clatter of the dustcart, and the wild beating of carpets in echoing courtyards are bad. It seems that in this country people have an almost morbid fear of dirt. Yesterday they started entertaining me with the stutter of a pneumatic drill; somewhere they are tearing up the street so that later they can pave it again. I often feel as though I am the only unoccupied person in this town. To judge by the voices in the street, when the pneumatic drill stops for a minute, there is much cursing and little laughter here. Round midnight the drunks start bawling because at this hour all the pubs are shut. Sometimes students sing as though one were in the heart of Germany. Around one o'clock silence falls. But it's not much use putting out the light; a distant street-lamp shines into my cell, the shadows of the bars stretch across the <!--leaf015:

<p align="left">Without the warder, who brings me my food, I shouldn't know to this day what's really going on here. Every newspaper reader seems to know who Stiller was.

The yard is pretty big&#x2014;paving-stones with moss growing in between, a fine plane tree in the centre, ivy on the walls, and of course the fact that we are not yet wearing convict's clothes, but the civilian clothes we had on when we were arrested, makes a lot of difference. If we widen the circle in which we have to walk we can see a flat roof with flapping washing; apart from this there is only sky around the roofs, which are covered with cooing pigeons. Unfortunately, we have to keep in single file, which makes proper conversation <!--leaf017:

In front of me walks a fat man with a shiny bald patch (like myself) and folds of fat on the back of his neck, who paddles himself along with his arms when he's made to walk&#x2014;probably a newcomer; when a friendly warder tells him it's time for his walk, he looks round (which costs him a physical effort) half stubbornly, half bewildered, dumbly seeking support. Support against what? Behind me goes the Italian who is so fond of singing in the shower-bath, and the warders can't help laughing at his comic imitation of myself. Once I looked round to see my portrait. It was funny enough: hands behind the back, the attitude of a thinker, always slightly out of line through absent-mindedness, a look of nostalgia for distant places combined with yearning glances over the nearest brick wall, a man who shyly flatters himself he doesn't belong here, and on top of this the awkward cordiality of the intellectual. It's probably a good likeness, anyhow even the Jew has to laugh, the only intellectual among the prisoners, who unfortunately walks in the other half of the circle, so that we can only converse in grimaces and gestures. He seems to have very little faith in Swiss justice...</p>
<p>Suddenly someone began playing football with a raw potato; there were a few brisk passing movements before the head warder, a very correct man who always takes it as a personal insult when anything discreditable happens, finally spotted the potato. Squad halt! A serious inquiry as to where the potato came from. We stood in a circle grinning, not saying a word. The head warder walked from man to man, the peeled potato in his hand, and looked each of us in the eye. Everyone shrugged his shoulders. The head warder had missed the chance of simply throwing the potato away, against his wish the matter had suddenly become important, a matter of principle. I had the feeling it was all a farce and the head warder himself was finding it hard not to laugh and dismiss the lot of us. At the same time I felt that perhaps they had a torture chamber after all, perhaps the stolen potato was enough to make them come with red-hot irons. Suddenly my Jew put up his hand, to the accompaniment of general laughter. Even the head warder realized that this admission could only be an act of derision (he had never seen a Jew who played football) which was worse than the theft of an <!--leaf018:

The Jew, white with agitation, had to step out of the ranks. The rest of us were told to go round at the double for five minutes. Of course the poor fat fellow in front of me, wobbling like a hot-water bottle, was left behind on the first time round and ran in a spiral to shorten the distance, until a warder told him to fall out. They were not inhuman. But order must be maintained and also a certain gravity. After all, we were in a remand prison...</p>
<p>There are times, alone in my cell, when I have the feeling that I have only dreamed all this; that at any moment I could stand up, take my hands away from my face and look round in freedom, as though the prison were only within me.</p>
<break type="graphic"/>
<p align="left">'I've done my best,' said my defending counsel, 'to make your stay in the remand prison, which I hope will be short, as comfortable as possible&#x2014;whisky is not allowed. You have the best room in the building, believe me, not the biggest, but the only one with morning sunshine; you have this view into the old chestnut tree. As to the bells of the Cathedral, they're very loud, I admit; but what do you expect me to do? I can't put the Cathedral somewhere else.'</p>
<p>That was quite right, just as everything my counsel says is right in a way that never convinces me and yet always puts me in the wrong. The ringing of the cathedral bells, a metallic hum which breaks out at least twice a day and more often when there are weddings or funerals, makes it impossible to hear oneself think; it is like a trembling of the air, a soundless quaking, a noise like a man diving into the water from an excessively high diving board; it makes me deaf, dizzy, and idiotic. But my counsel is right; he can't put the cathedral somewhere else. And as I then remain silent out of sheer hopelessness, he picks up his folder and says:</p>
<p>'Right, let's get down to business.'</p>
<p>My counsel is a thoroughly decent, or at least inoffensive fellow, from a well-to-do family, virtuous through and through, rather inhibited, but even his inhibitions are turned into good manners; and above all, he is just, no doubt of that, just in even the most trivial matter, desperately just, just out of an almost <!--leaf019:

<p>At the same time, he's not stupid. He knows a great deal, he's as reliable as an encyclopedia, especially where Switzerland is concerned, so that there is really no point in discussing Switzerland with my counsel; every idea that casts doubt on Switzerland is smothered under a mass of indisputable historical facts, and in the end, if you don't actually praise his Switzerland, you are always in the wrong, just as I was wrong over the bells of their cathedral. Perhaps it's only his lack of temperament, his virtuousness, his moderation, which so immoderately irritate me; he is superior to me in intelligence, yet he employs all his intelligence simply to avoid making mistakes. I find such people unbearable. I can reproach him with nothing; he considers me a thoroughly decent, or at least inoffensive, fundamentally sensible fellow, a man' of good will, a Swiss. This is the basis on which he is conducting my defence, and every time I see him I nearly explode. Then I turn on my heels, leave him sitting on the bed and turn my back to him; I maintain an almost insulting silence arid stare out of the window at the old chestnut trees with my hands in my pockets, simply because in the long run I can't stand people of his sort&#x2014;people who can't imagine committing murder themselves, and therefore can't imagine that I could commit murder either.</p>
<p>'I understand you perfectly,' he said, 'I understand you perfectly. You're annoyed with Switzerland because it greets you with imprisonment, understandably&#x2014;I mean, understandably annoyed, for it is painful to look at one's homeland through bars&#x2014;'</p>

<p>In the end I kept my mouth shut. His time is limited; that's my only salvation from this thoroughly decent fellow who considers himself my defence counsel and is therefore offended because I don't do as he asks, after he has read the whole dossier. Finally he puts it back in the brief-case, presses the catch without a word until at last it clicks, stands up, makes sure he has got everything, his fountain pen, his glasses, and shakes hands with me as though he had just lost a game of tennis, telling me what time he'll be back tomorrow.</p>

<p>P.S. He's 'convinced of my innocence'. What does he mean by that? Suddenly the idea enters my head that there is some suspicion hanging over Stiller; that is why the authorities here are so keen to lay hands on their vanished citizen&#x2014;some affair has to be cleared up.</p>

<p align="left">Knobel (that's my warder's name) is a real gem, the only person who believes what I say.

It seems they take a lot of trouble over outward appearances. Even the window-bars get dusted in this country.</p>
<p>'Well, if you tell me yourself you murdered your wife&#x2014;' said my warder.</p>
<p>Fourteen years ago he was a greengrocer with a cart and a horse called Rossli, of which he speaks very affectionately. At first I thought he was talking about his wife.

He says he simply can't bear to listen to the twaddle talked by all those honest men. It must be nauseating. I hear the next cell is occupied by a banker, who weeps for hours at a time, and the next cell but one by a ponce, who likewise talks about honour. My warder is pleased with me, I think.

<p>'My second,' I said, skinning the sausage, 'oh that was nothing, I already knew I was a murderer, so I didn't have to get into a particular frame of mind first&#x2014;it was in the jungle.'</p>
<p>'You've been in the jungle, Mr White?'</p>

<p>'Well I'm blowed,' he said, 'well I'm blowed.'</p>
<p>'Do you know what the jungle's like?'</p>
<p>'Only from the films, Mr White.'</p>
<p>'Well that's just how it is,' I said and made quite a pause before coming to the point. 'I knew this Schmitz was knocking about in Jamaica and I went around for months with a dagger in my left boot.'</p>
<p>'Who's Schmitz?'</p>
<p>'Director Schmitz,' I said.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, since he has eight cells to look after, his time is short. Nevertheless, he always stays longer with me than with the others, the honest men. He's a real gem, whenever they feed the prisoners their over-ripe Swiss cheese, he always brings me a saveloy bought with his own money. True, saveloy (beer-sausage) isn't exactly my favourite dish, especially if I've no beer to go with it&#x2014;it's a rather garlicky sausage you can still smell hours afterwards, when you're thinking of something else; but I'm touched by the thought behind it.</p>

I see its vast arid expanse full of blossoming colours, where nothing else blossoms any more, colours of blazing noon, colours of dusk, colours of the indescribable night. I love the desert. Not a bird in the air, no trickling water, no insect, nothing all around but silence, nothing all around but sand and sand and again sand that isn't smooth, but combed and waved by the wind, like dull gold in the sun or like bone meal, in between hollows filled with shadow that is bluish like this ink, yes, as though filled with ink, and never a cloud, never even a trailer of vapour, never the sound pf a fleeing animal, only here and there the isolated cactuses, vertical, something like organ pipes or seven-branched candlesticks, but as high as a house, plants, but as rigid and motionless as architecture, not really green, more brownish like amber, as long as the sun is shining, and black like scissor-cuts against the blue night&#x2014;I see all this with open eyes, even though I shall never be able to describe it, dreamless and wide-awake and, as every time I see it, struck by the improbability of our existence. How much desert there is on this planet whose guests we are; I never knew before, I'd only read about it; I had never experienced how very much everything we live from is the gift of a small oasis, as improbable as grace. Once, somewhere under the murderous blaze of a noon without a breath of wind, we stopped; it was the first cistern for days, the first oasis on that journey. A few Indians came up to look at our vehicle, wordless and shy. Again cactuses along with a few dried-up agaves, a few withering palms, that was the oasis. You wonder what people do here. You wonder what man is doing on this earth at all, and you're glad to have to bother about an overheated engine.

When we were ready we drove on. In the distance we saw the red mountains, but they came no closer and often, even though I could hear the boiling engine, I could hardly distinguish whether we were moving or stationary. It was as if space no longer existed; only the changing times of day showed us that we were still alive. Towards evening the shadows of the house-high cactuses lengthened and so did our shadows; they flitted along beside us hundreds of yards long on the sand, which was now the colour of honey, and the daylight grew thinner and thinner, a transparent veil in front of the empty cosmos. But the sun was still shining, and the over-large moon, the same colour as the sandhills touched by the last rays of the sun, appeared out of a violet dusk without haze. We drove as fast as our jeep would go and at the same time not without the solemn knowledge that our eyes were absolutely the only ones to be seeing all this; without them, without our mortal human eyes travelling through the desert, there was no sun, only a vast sum of blind energy, without them no moon; without them no earth, no world at all, no consciousness of creation. We were filled, I remember, with a solemn arrogance; soon afterwards our back tyre burst.</p>

<p>I'm sitting in my cell staring at the wall and I see Mexico, the floating gardens of Mexico, gondolas on brownish water with flashing reflections of the azure, gondolas that glide along almost soundlessly, all decorated with fresh flowers, a corso on canals, all around gardens filled with everlasting spring, Arcadias, but Indian. An old Indian woman, her baby tied to her back, comes paddling along in a narrow canoe whose gunwhales scarcely rise above the brownish water bubbling under the paddles; in a soft, low voice she offers a bouquet, orchids such as I have never seen before, arranged with a masterly good taste handed down from ancient times. The Aztecs never had a festival without flowers. A half-breed is trying to sell pulque, the Mexican popular liquor, distilled from the agave juice; he swirls the cup around in the turbid water and hands me the drink. It tastes of fermentation, of the sticky heat and sweetness of the tropics. And all around in the gondolas sit families with bag and <!--leaf025:

A couple in the very first phase of their relationship&#x2014;they're sitting erect side by side and holding hands&#x2014;have hired a gondola full of musicians, full of guitars and enormous Mexican hats, full ofhoneyed voices coming from dark, bandits' faces. It's a corso of the people, half authentic and half fake, and I think of the desert again. That's what mankind is doing with the earth! A young girl is lying face down on the bow of a gondola, trailing both arms in the slowly flowing water, quiet and blissful, while from somewhere else comes a loud burst of laughter. But most people are quiet, as I said, almost lethargic, or at least drowsy; I see faces like those from a lost paradise, alien, the very last relics of the great city of the Aztecs that was surrounded by a lake, accessible only across two causeways, an Indian Venice as the Spanish chroniclers called it. For the Indians, who were unacquainted with the wheel, water was the best means of travel and the lake must have been a paradise; parts of the banks, it is written, used to break away and float like islands with all their flowers. The Indians, the people of the flowers, used to weave rafts of reeds, piling earth and waterweed on them, even planting small trees on them, and then they rowed these flowering islands about. Hence the name: the Floating Gardens. Later the lake turned into a marsh, dried up apart from this modest puddle, where now the Sunday gondolas, half authentic and half fake, remind us of the downfall of a wonderful people, and modern Mexico, the city with its well-built and its badly-built tower blocks, is literally standing on a morass, you can see its buildings sinking into the ground, ceaselessly, a few inches a year ... And I see the reddish land all around, the pyramids, the lava, the dead snake in the roadway, squashed by a tyre, and the vultures waiting, and I see the luxuriant orchids on the telephone wires, the big mushroom-shaped hats of the Mexican men, their white cotton shirts and their reddish skin. Mexican markets! They remind you of techni-colour films and they're just like that, picturesque, very picturesque and yet, in reality, there are moments when you suddenly feel afraid. There's a smell of dead dog. Children sit with their bare behinds on the garbage, on rotten fruit.

A carpenter nearby is making children's coffins, by the dozen, rough and cheap. And peasant women squatting on the pavement are selling pottery, the shapes reminiscent of Indian ware, but rough and cheap. The multitude of flowers is wonderful, but you can't catch their scent; where it doesn't stink of the horrible meat putrefying in the sun, it stinks oflatrines, and you have to make an effort not to transfer your disgust onto the people. It isn't a slum I'm looking at, but an open-air market and the place, I believe, is called Amecamea, a fine market, not depressing, only eerie. There is something demonic about the decay, as if it were a curse that changes everything that might blossom and give off a perfume into stench, into rottenness and putrefaction. And human beings have given up trying to defend themselves against it; no one clears away the dead dog; the most people do is to shoo away the flies with a weary movement before putting the tortilla in their mouths. Club feet and other deformities are part of the picture, the sun and the blue sky are like a dazzling mockery. I have a strange feeling that something is wrong. What's wrong? But nothing is wrong! It's all very picturesque, the mild amber light under the big awnings and in it the faces of the foreign women; up above the crumbling baroque of a Spanish church, a verdigris cross, orchids everywhere. And between the green leaves of the banana palms that hang down like big, tattered banners I see the eternal snow on Popocatepetl, the Smoking Mountain that no longer smokes, a white tent, marvellous. Where does eeriness come into it? And wherever our car stops to fill up I see a blind man stretching out his hand. In the coffee plantations there is a fly whose sting first causes a suppurating pimple that can be removed; but there's no doctor, no money for a doctor. Then the maggots get into the blood, finally into the eyes which then run like poached eggs, a whitish-yellow mush. So they stand there, old men and boys, blind and empty-handed. One of them is singing to a barrel-organ. And on the roofs perch the zopilotes, the big, stinking birds which, when you're travelling along a lonely road, often rise up in flocks from a corpse, a squashed snake, a putrefying donkey or a murdered man no one has missed yet; you can see <!--leaf027:

<p align="left">Fortunately my public prosecutor (or examining magistrate; I'm not well up in these things) is a pleasant character, a sceptic, who doesn't even believe everything he says himself; also he was the first one with the good manners to knock before coming into the cell.</p>
<p>'I suppose you know who I am?'</p>
<p>'The public prosecutor?'</p>
<p>His smile baffled me. He stared at me for a long time with both hands thrust into his jacket pockets, somehow embarrassed. My first idea was: This man has some confession to make to me. He seemed to lose himself in private thoughts of his own. For a while he behaved as though he were deaf, staring at me openly as adults rarely do, and in any case longer than was polite, so that when he realized what he was doing he blushed slightly.</p>
<p>'Do you smoke?' he asked, and when I refused, he added, taking a cigarette himself and lighting it: 'This is an entirely personal call. Please don't regard it as an interrogation. I felt the urge to make your acquaintance...'</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>'You really don't smoke?' he asked.</p>
<p>'Only cigars.'</p>
<p>'My wife sends her regards,' he said, sitting down on the bed like a regular visitor and gazing round for an ash-tray, just to avoid looking at me, I believe '&#x2014;that is if you really are Herr Stiller.'</p>
<p>'My name is White,' I said.</p>
<p>'I don't want to anticipate the judicial inquiry,' he said with an undertone of apology or relief, went on smoking and obviously didn't know what to say next under the circumstances. It wasn't for some minutes, after an exchange of small talk that was suddenly quite impersonal and rendered even more thread<!--leaf028: 
type:ent
 (ty at­) page:27 (28) re:oddchar_endp (:&lt;/p&gt;|:&lt;/p&gt;) -->bare by the fact that his mind was elsewhere&#x2014;chiefly about motor scooters and the fact that whisky, and alcohol generally, was 'unfortunately' strictly forbidden to prisoners on remand&#x2014;he declared abruptly: 'Personally, I've never seen Stiller. At least not consciously. We once had a talk over the telephone, as you may know; it was a call from Paris, but I can't tell whether it was you.'</p>
<p>Then his tone changed and he suddenly became good-humoured:</p>
<p>'You murdered your wife, Mr White?'</p>
<p>I had the feeling that he didn't believe me either. He was smiling, but his smile disappeared when we stared at one another in silence, and he asked me why I murdered my wife.</p>
<p>'Because I loved her,' I said.</p>
<p>'Is that a reason?'</p>
<p>'Look,' I explained, 'it was a sacrifice for her to live at my side; All my friends thought so, to say nothing of her friends. She herself hardly said a word about the way I made her suffer. She was a very noble person, you know, and you can ask anyone you like about that, everybody thought so. They had never seen such a noble, such a fine person as my wife, they all said. And we moved almost exclusively in educated circles. Besides, I thought so myself, I admired her, you know. Her nobility attracted me. That was her undoing. I can't tell you how often that woman forgave me, how often!'</p>
<p>'What for?'</p>
<p>'For being as I am.'</p>
<p>Every now and then he asked a question. For instance:</p>
<p>'Did you often quarrel?'</p>
<p>'Never.'</p>
<p>'Not even before the murder?'</p>
<p>'Certainly not,' I answered, 'otherwise it would never have been committed. You obviously can't picture my victim. She would never have dreamt of raising her voice, so I didn't dare to either. I told you, she was such a noble person&#x2014;can you imagine what it's like to be married to such a noble person? For nine years I was plagued by a bad conscience.

<p>'Hm,' he said.</p>
<p>'I deny nothing,' I said. 'But don't expect to see me with a bad conscience. I haven't got one any more. Somehow it has simply been used up. I had so much bad conscience while she was alive. It was terrible for her, simply terrible, to have to live at my side,'</p>

<p align="left">Once a week, every Friday, we're allowed to take a shower, ten minutes each, ten prisoners at a time. Otherwise I never see my neighbours; but then I see them stark naked and to the accompaniment of a steamy splashing, so that we can scarcely talk to one another. One of them, who considers himself innocent, refuses to soap himself out of spite. One little Italian always sings. There is not much to be learnt from the faces under the shower, distorted by strands of wet hair and soap. Added to this is the nakedness of the whole body: after being used to seeing the face as the only naked area, you are more or less compelled to look at the whole naked body, which is not very pleasant. All you can guess is that it belongs to a workman, an intellectual, an athlete, a clerk. On the whole, our naked bodies are thoroughly embarrassing, because they are inexpressive; at best they are natural, but generally they are rather ridiculous. I have made friends with a German Jew; we soap one another's backs, since he can't reach all over his either, and we agree that <!--leaf030:

Apart from myself, I fancy, there is no one guilty of a serious offence among us. Thanks to the fact that they put me near the end of the alphabet (as 'Stiller'), I have a little more time to chat to the German Jew. We have both come to the conclusion that physical hygiene in Switzerland is in remarkable contrast to the rest of their obsession with cleanliness. He told me that where he lived in the town he was only allowed by contract to take a hot shower at week-ends, as in the prison. Then we march off to our cells one by one with bath towels round our necks.</p>

<p align="left">Dear Brother,</p>
<p>You can imagine that since getting the news from your local canton police I have scarcely slept a wink. Anny too is very excited. Anny is my dear wife, I'm sure you will like her. Don't be angry with me for not coming to Z&#xFC;rich at once, but it's simply impossible at the moment. I hope you are not ill, at least, dear brother. Your photograph gave me a shock&#x2014;you looked so thin on it that I could hardly recognize you. Have you been to see Father in the old age home yet? Don't listen to what he says, he is an old man now and you know what he's like. You know that Mother is dead? She suffered less than we feared she might. We will visit her grave together. When the canton police told us you had returned, I thought most of Mother. She often used to think you were on the point of coming home; she didn't say so, but we knew very well why she stayed up later than usual, she imagined you were coming back that evening. I just want to tell you that Mother always took your part. Whenever your name cropped up she used to say she hoped you were happy.</p>
<p>Of course, we are very anxious to hear your story, dear brother, for nothing much has happened to us. I'm a manager here, so you see nothing came of my farm in Argentina&#x2014;it was simply impossible to leave Mother just then, but we're doing quite nicely.</p>

I can well understand that afterwards she didn't want to see any more of us, being your family. But I think she's still living in Paris. Perhaps you've already spoken to Julika.</p>
<p>I hope you won't mind, but I must stop now: we're just having a fruit show that's to be attended by a member of the Federal Council, and I've hardly asked you a proper question yet about your life and your future. I hope you will very soon be free.</p>

<p>He stared at me.</p>
<p>'What do you mean by that?'</p>
<p>For the first time the idea entered his honest head that I might not be their missing Herr Stiller after all. Then who could I be? I gave him a few suggestions: Perhaps I was a Soviet agent with American papers. No joking please, and anyhow, in his opinion, anything connected with the Soviets was not a fit subject for jokes; it was simply too evil, just as, on the other hand, anything to do with Switzerland was too good to be a fit subject for jokes. I made another suggestion: Perhaps I was an S.S. man who had been underground for a bit and now saw an opening, the Unknown War Criminal with experience of the East, now very much in demand. But how could I prove I was a war criminal? However candidly I swore to it, they wouldn't let me go without proof. My counsel doesn't even believe that <!--leaf032:

<p>My counsel isn't interested in the way the Indians tear the cobra's fangs out in order to use them for their celebrated snake dance. He is even less interested in the Indians' attitude to death. And not at all in who ordered the murder of the Mexican revolutionaries. And he doubts whether it is true that the Mexican sky belongs to the vultures and Mexican mineral resources to the Americans. It's really not easy to keep this man entertained for an hour a day. He interrupted me in the middle of a story which I, at least, was finding enthralling:</p>
<p>"Orizaba&#x2014;where's that?'</p>
<p>He whipped out his Eversharp and wouldn't rest until he had made a note of my polite but brief reply. Then he immediately asked me:</p>

<p>Today my counsel opened with the remark: 'You don't seem to be very well informed about Mexico.'</p>
<p>My counsel had been working.</p>
<p>'What you told me yesterday is a lot of rubbish. Look,' he said and showed me a book from the municipal library. 'Benito Juarez tried to do away with large-scale landed property. He was unsuccessful. Porfirio Diaz was overthrown because he ruled with the support of the big property owners, and as you may know there followed a series of bloody revolutions aimed-at breaking up the big estates. Monasteries were burnt, landowners shot, and it ended with the dictatorship of the revolutionaries. You can read all that in here. Go on, have a look. And then you talk to me about a flourishing <emph type="2">hacienda</emph> that's supposed to be as big as a Swiss canton&#x2014;'</p>
<p>'Yes,' I said, 'if not bigger.'</p>
<p>My counsel shook his head.</p>
<p>'Why do you tell me such tall stories?' he said. 'You must see that we shan't get anywhere like this. It's just not true. I don't believe you've ever been to Mexico.'</p>
<p>'All right,' I said, 'have it your own way.'</p>
<p>'Who could have owned an <emph type="2">hacienda</emph> like that in modern Mexico, he said, 'under a government that expressly forbids all large-scale land ownership?'</p>
<p>'A member of the government itself&#x2014;'</p>
<p>This was a point my counsel didn't want to go into. Anything not quite above board makes him feel uneasy, and above all as an honest Swiss he can't bear to see abuses laughed at instead of being denounced and definitely relegated to the other side of the Iron Curtain. To back up his viewpoint he quickly pointed out that Mexico was a Communist country, an explanation which, from my first-hand knowledge, I could not accept. Apart from the fact that Mexico's mineral resources are mostly <!--leaf034:

<p>Meanwhile I find the story of my <emph type="2">hacienda</emph> minister so amusing that I cannot forbear to tell it: He was, I believe, a manufacturer of office chairs, such as every State needs in large quantities. He wasn't the only manufacturer of office chairs. Once he had been elected Minister of Trade&#x2014;so that he personally occupied a State office chair&#x2014;for the sake of something to do, he imposed a ban on imports, to the great distress of those who delighted in the manufacture of office chairs. Raw materials fell into short supply everywhere. The Minister of Trade did not sit easy in his chair, as may be imagined, and when the right moment came&#x2014;that is to say, when he had bought up the materials in short supply in the United States and stored them tidily on the other side of the frontier&#x2014;he could no longer resist the entreaties of his competitors, and lifted the import ban for a fortnight. All the rest, of course, were too late with their orders, went bankrupt, and were only too glad to accept the merger that was offered them. But the Minister of Trade, although above reproach, felt no further urge to sacrifice himselffor his fatherland; he retired to the dilapidated <emph type="2">hacienda</emph> with which the State, so to speak, rewarded him, and tended it with heart and soul and some thousand labourers, whose picturesque straw hats I shall never forget. As we sat on the shady veranda, we used to see them like white mushrooms out in the flowering, burning hot fields; and soon it was indeed a model <emph type="2">hacienda</emph>, a paradise on earth...</p>

<p align="left">I shall tell her the little story of Isidore. A true story. Isidore was a dispensing chemist, that's to say a conscientious fellow who made a pretty good living, the father of several children and a man in the prime of life, and there is no need to emphasize that Isidore was a faithful husband. Nevertheless, he couldn't stand his wife's perpetual inquiries as to where he had been. They made him furious&#x2014;inwardly furious, he didn't show a sign on the outside. It wasn't worth quarrelling about, for at bottom, as I have said, theirs was a happy marriage. One fine summer, as was the fashion just then, they made a trip to Mallorca, and apart from her never-ending questions, which annoyed him on the quiet, everything went well. Isidore could be extremely affectionate when he; was on holiday. They were both delighted with the beauty of Avignon, and walked along arm in arm. Isidore and his wife, whom we must imagine as a very amiable woman, had been married just nine years when they arrived in Marseille. The Mediterranean sparkled as it does on posters. To the silent annoyance of his wife, who was already on board the steamer for Mallorca, Isidore had to go back at the last moment to buy a paper. It may be that he did it partly out of pure spite because she asked him where he was going. God knows, he didn't mean to; it was simply that, as their steamer wasn't going yet, he went for a bit of a stroll. Out of pure spite, as I have said, he plunged into his French newspaper, and while his wife was actually sailing to picturesque Mallorca, Isidore, when the wail of a siren at last made him look up with a start from his paper, found himself not at the side of his wife, but on a rather dirty tramp steamer filled to overflowing with men in yellow uniforms and also under steam. The great hawsers had just been cast off. Isidore watched the quay recede into the distance. Whether it was the devilish heat or the <!--leaf037:

Flight was out of the question. The yellow fort, where they made a man of Isidore, stood alone in the desert, whose sunsets he learnt to appreciate. No doubt he sometimes thought of his wife, when he was not simply too tired, and he would probably have written to her; but writing was not allowed. France was still fighting against the loss of her colonies, so that Isidore had soon seen more of the world than he would ever have allowed himself to dream. He forgot his chemist's shop, of course, as others forgot their criminal past. In time Isidore even lost his homesickness for the country that claimed in writing to be his home, and it was pure decency on Isidore's part when&#x2014;many years later&#x2014;he came through the garden gate one fine morning, bearded, lean as he now was, his sola topi under his arm, so that the neighbours&#x2014;who had long ago assumed the chemist to be dead&#x2014;should hot be distressed by his somewhat unusual attire; naturally he also wore a belt with a revolver. It was a Sunday morning, his wife's birthday, as I've said, he loved her, even though he had not written her a postcard in all those years. He paused for an instant, looking at his unaltered home, his hand on the garden gate, which had not been oiled and creaked as it always used to. Five children, all bearing a certain resemblance to himself, but all seven years older, so that their appearance took him by surprise, were already shouting 'Daddy' from a distance. There was no turning back.</p>
<p>So Isidore strode on with the determination of a man who had seen hard fighting, and in the hope that his dear wife, if at home, would not ask for an explanation. He strolled across the lawn as though he was coming back as usual from his shop, and not from Africa and Indo-China. His wife sat speechless under a new sunshade. Isidore had never seen the expensive dressing gown she was wearing before either. A maid&#x2014;another innovation&#x2014;immediately fetched a second cup for the bearded gentleman, whom without doubt, but also without disapproval, she took for the new 'friend of the family'. 'It's cool here,' said <!--leaf038:

 ( home­) page:37 (38) -->Isidore, pulling down his rolled-up shirtsleeves. The children were delighted at being allowed to play with the sola topi, which naturally led to some quarrelling, and when the fresh coffee arrived it was a perfect idyll, Sunday morning with bells ringing and birthday cake. What more could Isidore want? Without a thought for the new maid, who was just laying the cutlery, Isidore grabbed his wife. 'Isidore,' she cried and was unable to pour out the coffee, so that the bearded guest had to do it himself. 'What is it?' he asked affectionately, filling her cup up at the same time. 'Isidore,' she cried, close to tears. He put his arms around her. 'Isidore,' she asked, 'where have you been all this time?' The man, as though momentarily stunned, put down his cup; he was simply not used to being married, and stood in front of a rose tree with his hands in his pockets. 'Why didn't you write me so much as a postcard?' she asked. Thereupon he took his topi away from the dumbfounded children without a word, set it with military precision on his own head, which is supposed to have left an indelible impression on the children for the rest of their lives&#x2014;Daddy with a sola topi and revolver holster that were not only genuine, but showed visible signs of use&#x2014;and when his wife said, 'You know, Isidore, you really shouldn't have done it,' it was all over with Isidore's cosy homecoming. He drew (once more, I expect, with military precision) his revolver from his belt and fired three shots into the still untouched cake decorated with sugar icing, which, as may readily be imagined, caused a pretty frightful mess. 'Isidore,' screamed his wife, for her dressing gown was spattered all over with whipped cream&#x2014;if the innocent children had not been there as witness she would have thought the whole visit, which cannot have lasted more than ten minutes, a hallucination. Surrounded by her five children like a Niobe, she watched Isidore the irresponsible walk coolly out through the garden gate, the impossible topi on his head.</p>
<p>After this shock the poor woman could never look at birthday cake without thinking of Isidore, a pitiable state of affairs. Her friends advised her confidentially to get a divorce, but the brave woman still hoped. Her husband's guilt was obvious. But she still hoped he would relent, lived entirely for the five children she had by Isidore, and like a Penelope put off for another year <!--leaf039:

'Isidore,' said his wife, 'where have you been this time?' He stood up, without shooting, thank goodness, and without taking his topi away from the innocent children, rolled up his sleeves again, and went out through the garden gate never to return. His poor wife wept as she signed the divorce petition, but it had to be, especially as Isidore did not put in an appearance within the legally specified period; his chemist's shop was sold; the second marriage proceeded without ostentation and after the legally specified period had elapsed was also sanctioned by the registry office; in short, everything followed an orderly pattern, as was so important for the growing children. There was never any answer to the question of where Daddy had got to. Not even a picture postcard. Mummy didn't want the children to ask where he was; she ought never to have asked Daddy herself...</p>

<p>'Word of honour&#x2014;have you really been in Mexico?' he asked. 'Joking apart.'</p>
<p>It's funny how a little thing like a one-franc cigar immediately puts you under an obligation, making it quite impossible for me to turn my back on the donor without a word, in answer to his question ... Have I really been in Mexico! Anyone can say Yes, but not everyone, I thought to myself, can relate what a backache a lower shrub-leaf, like the one on this cigar, gives the poor picker on the plantation; for these lower leaves are tougher than the upper ones, grey with dust, sandy, and brittle, so that they are all too liable to break. But the picker is only paid for absolutely faultless goods. These lower leaves are used to wrap the fine cigars. Only the perfect article can be employed...</p>
<p>'Yes, yes,' said my counsel. 'No doubt, but what has that to do with my question?'</p>
<p>I smoked. I described my work on the Uruapan tobacco plantation. A hard time. On my knees from morning to evening. You can't pick the lower leaves any other way: even on your knees you have to bend to find the best leaves. Once, I shall never forget it, I was crawling along from shrub to shrub, a Mexican straw hat on my head, without catching a glimpse of the other pickers. I waited in vain for the overseer's whistle. Despite my economic position I simply couldn't stand the heat any longer, wages or no wages. The stench of sulphur was getting stronger and stronger. I yelled out, suddenly seized with terror. From the grey earth just behind me a little cloud of yellow smoke billowed forth. In vain I shouted to the other labourers, mostly Indians; they had already fled. My feet, too, could bear the heat no longer, and I ran, but where to? The air was full of smoke like a stag party where everyone is smoking cigars, and I could see fissures opening up in the earth around me, soundless fissures from which came the stench of sulphur. I ran on at random until I was panting so hard that I could run no further. Then I looked back at our plantation and saw it rise and arch itself and become a small hill. A thrilling spectacle, but heat and smoke drove me on. I cried out the news in the village. The women gathered together their children and sobbed; the men decided to send a telegram to the owner of the plantation that was turning into a volcano. After a few <!--leaf041:

The village could neither work nor sleep; the sun shone as always, but it stank of sulphur, poisonous and hot, so that one would have liked to stop breathing; and the moon shone out of a cloudless night sky, but there was thunder. The little church was filled to overflowing, the bells rang without pause, occasionally drowned by the thunderous eruptions of the mountain.</p>
<p>No answer came to the telegram, so we had to take steps to save ourselves. Fire glowed through the smoke that clouded the moon. And then came the lava, slowly, but irresistibly, cooling and setting in the air, a black broth giving off swirling white steam; only during the night could you see the glow inside the stone broth that came nearer and nearer, as high as a house, nearer and nearer&#x2014;thirty yards a day. Birds flitted about in bewilderment because they could not find their nests, and forests disappeared under the red hot lava, mile by mile. The village was evacuated. I don't believe a single human life was lost. Carrying their weeping children in their arms or on their backs, laden with bundles containing little of value, they drove their distracted beasts in front of them, the donkeys braying and becoming more stubborn the more despairingly they were beaten. The lava flowed casually between the houses, filling them and swallowing them up. Being one of those who had no animal to save, I stood on a hill and watched the lava advancing: it hissed like a snake, turning every drop of water it came upon into steam, and it had a skin like certain snakes, a metallic grey skin, crusty over a soft, hot, and mobile interior. Finally it reached the church; the first tower fell to its knees and was swallowed up with all its hurtling debris; the other stood fast and is still standing today, a tower with a little Spanish dome, the only thing left out of the whole village...</p>
<p>'The village was called Paricutin. Now that is the name of the new volcano,' I finished my story, 'and if you ever go to Mexico, my dear Doktor, drive out to this Paricutin.

Not so long ago the eruptions succeeded one another at pretty short intervals&#x2014;six minutes, ten minutes, three minutes, each eruption throwing up a cascade of glowing stones, most of which were extinguished before they struck the ground. It's a first-class firework, believe me. Especially the lava. From the middle of a dark heap of dead slag, on which the moon shines without detracting from its blackness, the lava shoots out bright crimson, in spurts, like blood from a black bull. It must be very thin and runny, this lava, it sweeps down over the hillside almost as quick as lightning, gradually losing its brightness, until the next eruption comes glowing like a blast furnace, gleaming like the sun, lighting up the night with the deadly heat to which all life is due, with the molten heart of our planet. That's a sight you must see.

It's a tricky business. You stand for hours on your reef, in the dry; the spray from the surf flies up and falls, but it never rises beyond a certain point, it never comes up over your reef; you feel as safe as a solid citizen, and suddenly a wave comes along that is higher than the rest, God knows why, fifteen feet higher; if you don't spot it in time, that wave, as it foams over the reef full of seals, then you're drowned, honest man or no, smashed against the rocks, a drifting corpse that is never identified...</p>
<p>'There was a cloudless moon as I stood there, deafened by the breakers, when suddenly I saw smoke billowing up over the shore behind me, so much smoke that it looked like an eclipse of the sun. That can only be the big sawmill, I thought at once, in this lonely neighbourhood. You must imagine what it was like: not a single house within a radius of twenty miles, nothing but rocks and sheep and a wire-rope with which they lowered the logs from the wild forest, and when I looked up at the hill the sky was full of flying sparks; I've never seen such a fire and you should have heard it crackle; and not a trace of a fire-engine, naturally, only the women standing round sobbing and biting their fingers, and praying to God to stop blowing with his wind; no water to put it out with and it was Sunday, so the men were off somewhere playing bowls, and here there was a flapping and slapping in the air like crimson banners&#x2014;a glorious sight&#x2014;flames flickered out of every window, there was nothing to be done; outside lay a whole ocean full of wind, and as it blew into the huge stack of dry timber the heat was so terrific it was unbearable at a hundred paces; and right in the middle stood a tank full of petrol.'</p>

"Have you a car?" she asked. There are plenty of cars about, I thought, and as she put her arms round me so that I could carry her better, the roof began to crack and set the sparks dancing. I carried her out like a casualty, dumped her in the first car I came on standing in the street, and off we went. It was a Plymouth. The owner, probably a commercial traveller, never noticed as I drove past him, everyone was staring at the petrol tank that was going to explode at any moment.'</p>

I should say they are glittering, somehow watery, even when she is not crying, bluish-green like the edges of colourless window-glass, and at the same time, of course, full of soul and therefore opaque. Unfortunately her eyebrows have been plucked to a thin line, which gives her face a graceful hardness, but also a slightly masklike appearance, as though perpetually miming surprise. Her nose looks very aristocratic, especially from the side; there is a great deal of involuntary expression in her nostrils. Her lips are rather thin for my taste, not without sensuality, but they must first be roused; and her figure (in a black tailor-made costume) has something spare and also boyish about it; it's easy to see she's a dancer; perhaps it would be more <!--leaf049:

Her very slender hand, when she stubs out the half-smoked cigarette, is by no means lacking in strength and a considerable measure of forcefulness, although she seems to see herself as completely fragile. She speaks very softly, to prevent her interlocutor from shouting. She banks on being protected. I believe this little ruse, too, is unconscious. And she smells intoxicating, just as Knobel said; it must be a very high-class make, one immediately thinks of Paris, of the perfumeries in the Place Vendome.</p>
<p>'How are you?' she inquired.</p>
<p>Her habit of always answering one question with another is something you find in many women, in fact in all women, and I'm quite familiar with it. This made it all the more necessary for me to guard against the insidious feeling of having met her before.</p>
<p>'Don't you recognize me?' she asked.</p>
<p>Her fixed idea that I am her missing husband was by no means assumed; it came out in even her most trivial remarks.</p>
<p>'Don't you smoke any more?' she asked.</p>
<p>Later&#x2014;because you can't keep a conversation going indefinitely with nothing but questions, especially when they are not even genuine questions, since she would only accept one answer and simply ignored all others as being prevarication&#x2014;I told her the little tale of Isidore, adapting it to the case of my beautiful visitor by omitting the five children and making free use of a dream I had recently: when Isidore turned up at home he did not fire at the birthday cake, but merely showed his two hands covered with scars ... A crazy dream.</p>
<p>'Oh,' sighed my lady, 'you're still the same, one can't get a word of sense out of you, nothing but freaks of fancy.'</p>
<p>First it was comical, then annoying, but somehow also touching. This lady from Paris sitting on my bed in her black costume, smoking one cigarette after another, was anything but a stupid person, and I could imagine spending a delightful afternoon with her, more than an afternoon in fact. Above all, her rather tired and for some reason bitter laugh was enchanting, making one curious about the experience that lay behind it, time and <!--leaf050:

But it seemed she couldn't get away from her fixed idea that she knew me. She simply refused to believe I could be anyone else than her missing Stiller. She kept on talking about her marriage, which, I gathered, had not been all that a marriage should be. Several times I indicated my regret. When I finally got a chance to speak&#x2014;she didn't talk incessantly, far from it, she interspersed her conversation with frequent pauses during which she puffed hastily at her cigarette, long minutes of bitter silence it would have required more courage to interrupt than a spate of words&#x2014;when I finally got a chance to speak, I said:</p>
<p>'I suppose you've been told, Madame, that you are talking to a murderer?'</p>
<p>She ignored my remark as though it were a joke that had fallen flat.</p>
<p>'I'm a murderer,' I repeated at the next opportunity, 'even if the Swiss police can't establish the fact. I murdered my wife.'</p>
<p>It was no use.</p>
<p>'You're funny,' she said. 'You're really funny, I must say. At a time like this, when we haven't seen one another for half a lifetime, you start with your freaks of fancy again, your childish freaks of fancy.'</p>
<p>Again and again, I admit, her gravity made me momentarily uncertain, not uncertain about the fact that I had murdered my wife, but uncertain whether I should succeed in freeing this unhappy lady from her fixed idea. What did she want of me? I also tried gravity as a means of convincing her that there had never been a marriage between us, remaining grave even when she jumped up from my bed, walked up and down shaking her red hair, stood in front of my barred window smoking, her slender hands in the scanty pockets of her tight-fitting tailor-made, not saying a word but staring out at the autumnal chestnut tree, so that I could not see her face.</p>
<p>'Madame,' I said, taking one of her cigarettes, 'you flew down here to forgive your lost husband; you have waited years for this grave, indeed solemn hour, and I can understand that it's a blow for you to find that I'm not the man you have waited for with all your desire to forgive everything. I'm not the man, Madame.'</p>

<p>Her only answer was to puff out smoke.</p>
<p>'I think,' I said, now smoking myself, 'that is obvious, there is no need to discuss it.'</p>
<p>'What's obvious?'</p>
<p>'That I'm not your lost husband.'</p>
<p>'Why not?' she asked without looking at me.</p>
<p>At least I could see the back of her shapely head.</p>
<p>'Madame,' I said with undiminished gravity,. 'I'm deeply moved to hear you speak of your unhappy marriage, but, if you will forgive my saying so, the more I listen to you the less I understand what you want of me, in fact I don't understand at all. What can a lady like you, who, thank God, have so brilliantly recovered from the effects of your unhappy marriage, want with me&#x2014;a man who murdered his wife. To be quite frank, I don't understand what it is you want to forgive me?'</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>'You live in Paris?' I asked.</p>
<p>Then the figure turned. Her face, partially unmasked by quiet dismay and more beautiful than before, making one think that contact must be possible, contact in the realm of truth&#x2014;her face had for a short space of time a look that made me want to kiss her on the brow, and perhaps I ought to have done so, regardless of whether she misinterpreted it or not; for a short space of time, then her face seemed to close again and back she came with her fixed idea:</p>
<p>'Anatol, what's the matter with you?'</p>
<p>Again I told her:</p>
<p>'My name is White.'</p>
<p>She simply turned the tables, acting as though I were the one with the fixed idea. She threw her lighted cigarette out of the barred window (which is strictly forbidden, like so much here) and stood in front of me without taking hold of me of course, but knowing quite well that I should take hold of her and suddenly overcome by remorse beg her forgiveness. And in fact for a few moments we were quite defenceless, we smiled, although it wasn't funny at all. I might have looked like a gnome, a minotaur, anything you like, and it would have made no difference whatever; she was simply incapable of perceiving any other being than her vanished Stiller.</p>

Her loose hair was gloriously silky and as light as gossamer. She was breathing heavily as though she had been running, her chest heaving and her mouth open. Her front teeth were splendid, not without fillings, but otherwise gleaming like mother of pearl. And since I had gripped her delicate lower jaw with my other hand, she was incapable of speaking.

<p align="left">Freaks of fancy! I'm supposed to tell my life story, and when I try to make myself understood they say, 'Freaks of fancy'. (At least I know now where my counsel picked up this expression together with the patronizing smile that goes with it.) He listens as long as I talk about my house in Oakland, about Negroes and other facts; but as soon as I come to the real story, as soon as I try to tell him things that cannot be verified by a photograph&#x2014;for example, what happens after you put a bullet in your temple&#x2014;my counsel cleans his finger-nails and waits for a chance to interrupt me with some trifle.</p>

<p>'Opposite San Francisco.'</p>
<p>'Ah,' said my counsel, 'really?'</p>
<p>It was thirteen feet wide and forty-two feet long (my counsel makes a note, that's the sort of thing he wants to know) and to be quite exact it was really more of a shingle-hut. It once housed the labourers of a farm, but the farm was swallowed up by the town and only the now tumble-down hut remained, along with a giant tree, a eucalyptus&#x2014;I shall never forget the silvery rustle of its leaves. Round about there was nothing but roofs, a sky filled with leaning telephone poles carrying the washing of my Negro neighbours. To be precise again, there were Chinese living on my right. And the little overgrown garden must not be forgotten. On Sundays you heard the Negroes singing in their wooden church. Otherwise there was silence, a great deal of silence, occasionally broken by the hoarse wail of sirens from the harbour and the rattle of chains that makes the blood curdle. Incidentally, I wasn't the owner of this little shingle-hut, only the tenant. I had absolutely no money at the time. The rent consisted in my having to feed the cat. I can't stand cats. But the cat's food stood ready in green tins, and in compensation I <!--leaf054:

<p>He had even got beyond making a note of the cat ... Yet this cat, I now believe, was the first warning. Her owners called her Little Grey and had always fed her in the kitchen, a custom I was not inclined to continue, because of the smell apart from anything else. I opened the daily tin and tipped the revolting stuff on to a plate in the garden, an arrangement which on her side, spoilt as she was, the cat was not inclined to accept. She jumped up to the sill of my open window and glowered at me with her green eyes, spitting. How could I read under such circumstances? I flung her out into the Californian night, a bundle with kicking paws, and shut all the windows. She crouched outside the pane and spat, she spat for hours at a time, for weeks on end, whenever I looked at her. I never failed to give her the tinned food, that was my duty, the only one I had at that time. And she never failed to slip into the house again through some open window (I couldn't spend the whole summer behind closed windows), unexpectedly rubbing herself against my legs just when I was feeling happy. It became a real struggle, a ridiculous struggle to see who could hold out longest, a horrible struggle; night after night I lay awake because she was howling round my hut, denouncing me to the whole neighbourhood as a cruel man. I let her in and shoved her into the refrigerator, but still I couldn't sleep. When I took pity on her, she had stopped spitting; I warmed her some milk, which she vomited. She looked at me as though threatening to die. She was quite capable of ruining everything for me, the little shingle-hut, the garden&#x2014;She was there even when she wasn't there; she brought me to the point of going to look for her when it was time to shut up for the night. I asked the Negroes sitting on the kerb whether they had seen Little Grey, and they shrugged their round shoulders. She stayed away eleven days and nights. One hot evening, just when Helen had come to see me, she jumped on to the window sill. 'My goodness,' cried Helen; the cat was sitting there with a gaping wound in her face <!--leaf055:

<p align="left">Went to Davos yesterday. It's just as Thomas Mann describes it. Moreover it rained all day long. Nevertheless I had to go for a very special walk, during which Julika made me look at squirrels while my counsel kept handing me fir-cones to smell. As though I had denied the aromatic smell of fir-cones. Later, in a very special restaurant, I had to eat snails, which are a famous delicacy but make you stink of garlic afterwards. All the time I could clearly observe Julika and my counsel exchanging glances, waiting for me to let slip some admission, or at least burst into tears. None the less I greatly appreciated eating off a white tablecloth again. Since conversation flagged, I told them about Mexico&#x2014;the mountains round about, though very small, reminded me of Popocatepetl and the Cortez Pass, and I have always found the conquest of Mexico one of the most fascinating stories.</p>
<p>'May be,' said my counsel, 'but we're not here for you to tell us about Cortez and Montezuma.'</p>

The little outing cost about two hundred Swiss francs; my counsel and I went in the State prison van (meals for the driver and the police constable were extra), Julika by train. In better weather it would have been a pleasant bit of countryside, no doubt about it. Once, down in the valley, we overtook the train, Julika waved.</p>

<p align="left">Frau Julika Stiller-Tschudy discovered the old scar over my left ear and wanted to know how I got it. She kept on about it. I said to her:</p>
<p>'Somebody tried to shoot me.' 'No,' she said pressingly, 'seriously&#x2014;' I told her a story.</p>
<break type="graphic"/>
<p align="left">P.S. Julika, now that I have seen her more often, is quite different from what I thought at our first meeting. Just what she is like, I should find it hard to say. She has moments of unexpected grace, especially when my counsel is not there, moments of defenceless innocence, a sudden blossoming of the childhood years that were never lived, a face as it must have been the first instant it was awakened by the breath of the Creator. Then it is as though she were surprised herself- a lady in a black tailor-made costume and a Paris hat, generally surrounded by a veil of smoke&#x2014;surprised that no man has yet known her. I can't understand this vanished Stiller. She's a hidden maid waiting under the cover of mature womanhood, at moments so beautiful it takes your breath away. Didn't Stiller notice? There is nothing womanly this woman does not possess, at least potentially, smothered over perhaps, and her eyes alone (when she stops believing I'm Stiller for a moment) have a gleam of frank anticipation that makes you jealous of the man who will one day awaken her.</p>

<p align="left">Repetition. And yet I know that everything depends on whether one succeeds in ceasing to wait for life outside repetition, and instead, of one's free will (in spite of compulsion), manages to turn repetition, inescapable repetition, into one's life by acknowledging: This is I ... But again and again (here, too, there is repetition) it needs only a word, a gesture that frightens me, a landscape that reminds me, and everything within me is flight, flight without hope of getting anywhere, simply for fear of repetition&#x2014;</p>

<p>As I spoke (this is important) I held his silver lighter with the little flame without lighting the fragrant cigar, that one and only sensual pleasure available to me in my imprisonment on remand, no, notwithstanding my avid desire I repeated my question:</p>

<p>'You don't know it?'</p>
<p>'What?'</p>
<p>'The story of Rip van Winkle?'</p>
<p>Only by means of this trick&#x2014;that's to say by holding the lighter, which I relit every time it went out, and with the cigar in the other hand, all the time on the point of lighting the splendid cigar, indeed once setting the cigar aglow, so that all I had to do was to draw on it, but every time prevented&#x2014;prevented by Rip van Winkle, whose story was obviously more acutely important than my cigar&#x2014;only by means of this trick could I compel my busy defence counsel to listen at all.</p>
<p>The story goes something like this.</p>
<p>Rip van Winkle, a descendant of that intrepid van Winkle who opened up the country of America while serving under Hendrik Hudson, was a born lazybones but at the same time, it seems, a thoroughly good fellow, who didn't fish for the sake of the fish but in order to dream, for his head was full of so-called thoughts, which had little to do with his reality. His reality, a good little wife whom everyone in the village could only pity or admire, didn't have an easy time with him. Rip certainly felt he ought to have a trade, a masculine trade, and he liked to pretend he was a hunter, which had the advantage of allowing him to roam around for days on end where no one saw him. He generally came back without so much as a single pigeon, carrying nothing but a bad conscience. His little house was the most neglected in the whole village, to say nothing of his garden. Nowhere did the weeds flourish so merrily as in his garden, and it was always his goats that wandered off and fell into the ravines. He bore it without bitterness, for he was philosophically inclined, unlike his ancestors who all gazed down from the old pictures with every appearance of being men of action. For days at a time he would sit outside his dilapidated little house with his chin in his hand pondering why he wasn't really happy. He had a wife and two children, but he wasn't happy. He had expected more of himself; he was fifty and he still expected more, even if his good wife and his companions smiled about it. Only Bauz, his shaggy dog, understood him and wagged his tail when Rip took down his gun to go squirrel hunting. He had inherited the gun, a heavy thing with a great deal of ornament, <!--leaf063: 
type:bold
 (from his forefathers. They must have smiled to themselves when Rip talked about his hunting; what he had seen always exceeded what he had shot. And since his stories couldn't be roasted, his wife, the mother of two children, had soon had enough of them; she called him a lazy good-for-nothing, in front of everyone, which he couldn't stand. So in order to unburden himself of his stories, Rip used to spend almost every evening in the village tavern, where there were always a few people to listen to him, even if his stories couldn't be roasted. His splendid gun and the tired dog at his feet were witnesses enough when Rip talked about his hunting. People liked him, because he never spoke ill of anyone; on the contrary it seems as though he was always a bit afraid of the world and badly needed to be liked. He drank a bit too, no doubt. And if no one listened, that didn't matter either; in any case, Rip and his dog, which put its tail between its legs as soon as it heard Mrs van Winkle coming, didn't go home before midnight, because every evening there was a pal­aver of which Rip understood as little as his dog, a palaver while he took off his boots, and of course it was obvious things couldn't go on like this, but that had been obvious for years ... One day Rip and his faithful dog went squirrel hunting again, striding out as long as the village could see them; then, as usual, Rip made his first stop, taking a bite from his provisions while Bauz kept watch in case anyone should come round the hill. In return, as usual, Bauz got a small bone, and Rip lit his pipe in order to give his good old dog, who was loudly gnawing at the bare bone, a bit of a rest too. Finally they trotted on into the morning, into the wide sweep of hilly country above the glitter­ing Hudson, a glorious region as may still be seen today, and there was no lack of squirrels. God knows why Rip went on telling everyone he was a hunter! Sunk in thoughts that no one ever got to know, he strolled through the forest. There were hares here, yes, even a deer! Rip stood still and looked at the surprised animal with reverence, his hands in his jacket pockets, his gun on his shoulder, his pipe in his mouth. The deer, which obviously didn't imagine for a moment that he was a hunter, went on calmly grazing. I've got to be a hunter! Rip told himself, suddenly thinking of the tavern in the evening and of his faithful wife, and he put the gun to his shoulder. He took )

It was strange, the dog barked even though no shot had rung out, and at the same moment shouts came from the ravine: Rip van Winkle, Rip van Winkle!

But on his shoulders he carried a handsome little barrel of brandy. Rip didn't take long to respond to his call. You're a polite person, said the fellow with the goatee. You're a helpful person. And with these words, which Rip was so pleased to hear, he hoisted the barrel onto his shoulders, so that Rip abandoned any further questions. First they went uphill, then down into another ravine, an area Rip had never seen before. Even Bauz, the faithful dog, felt ill at ease, rubbing up against his master's legs and whimpering. For there was a sound like thunder coming from the ravine! At last they got to the point when the hard barrel was lifted from Rip's aching shoulders and he could straighten up and look around. This is Rip van Winkle, said the fellow with the goatee, and Rip found himself in the middle of a group of old gentlemen wearing Dutch hats, with stiff, solemn faces and old-fashioned frills. No one said a word, only Rip nodded. It was, as it turned out, a group of skittle-players. Hence the booming and rumbling from the ravine! Rip had immediately to fill the jugs' each of the old gentlemen took a hearty swig, then they went silently back to their skittles and Rip, who liked to show himself polite, couldn't avoid setting up the skittles again. Only now and then, hur­riedly, was he able to take a gulp from the jug. It was gin, his favourite liquor! But once again the skittles flew apart and every time with a ringing crack that echoed through the whole ravine. Rip had his hands full. And there was no end to the cracking and rumbling.

They were a pretty strange group of people and, as I have said, not a word was spoken, so that Rip too didn't dare ask when he was going to be released from this drudgery. Their faces between the Dutch hats and the old-fashioned frills, as worn by his ancestors, were so dignified. Only as Rip set up the skittles again he had the disagreeable feeling that they were grinning behind his back, but Rip couldn't turn round and look because while his hand was still on the last skittle, that was wobbling, he heard the booming rumble of the next ball and had to jump out of the way to prevent it from crushing his leg. It was impossible to see when this drudgery would ever come to an end. The barrel of brandy seemed to be inexhaustible, again and again Rip had to fill the jugs, again and again they took a gulp, again and again they went silently back to their skittles. There was only one thing for it: Rip must wake up!... The sun was already sinking into the brown haze of evening as Rip sat up and rubbed his eyes. It was time to go home, high time. But he whistled in vain for his dog. For a while, still half in a dream, Rip looked around for the ravine and the skittle-players with their Dutch hats and old-fashioned frills, but none of that existed! Beyond the forest the broad Hudson gleamed as always and if the dog had just come along faithfully wagging his tail, Rip would have thought no more about the dream. On his way home he would have turned over in his mind what he was going to tell them in the village. To be sure, these stories of his seemed to him a bit like the wobbly skittles that he had to keep putting up so the others could knock them down. Not a sign of Bauz! Finally, Rip picked up his gun from the grass, but just look, it was overgrown by junipers. Not only that, it was also rusty, the most miserable-looking gun in the world. The wooden butt was mouldy. Rip shook his head, turned the thing over in his hand a few times, then threw it away and rose to his feet. For the sun was already sinking. Rip just wouldn't believe that the bleached bones lying beside his knapsack were the last remains of his faithful dog Bauz. But what else could they be?

In this connexion, I am less bound by my oath, which I had to swear to my counsel to prevent him from coming with us, than by natural consideration for Julika; if I made off she would lose a sum I could never restore to her. Moreover, I'm allowed one or two glasses of whisky!

<p align="left">Z&#xFC;rich could be a charming little town. It stands at the lower end of a delightful lake, whose hilly banks are not disfigured by factories, but by villas, and as we had such pleasant weather for our outing yesterday, a blue September sky with a thin silvery haze, I was really enchanted&#x2014;not merely to please Frau Julika, whose generous bail makes it possible for me to go for trips like this every week, provided of course that I always return punctually to my prison. In this connexion, I am less bound by my oath, which I had to swear to my counsel to prevent him from coming with us, than by natural consideration for Julika; if I made off she would lose a sum I could never restore to her. Moreover, I'm allowed one or two glasses of whisky! She looks simply magnificent, this woman, I think so every time I see her with her fiery hair in the sunshine, the white Paris hat on top of it and her willowy figure&#x2014;I'm simply enchanted.</p>

 (The little Jew, with whom I had allied myself for purposes of back-soaping, was not at the showers today. When I remarked that I didn't grudge him his freedom, they merely raised their eyebrows. He was an intelligent man, and the rumour that he has committed suicide keeps occupying my mind. Of course, we are a group often, and if we hadn't soaped one another's backs I should probably never have noticed he had gone. It's not that I miss him, either.

When I remarked that I didn't grudge him his freedom, they merely raised their eyebrows. He was an intelligent man, and the rumour that he has committed suicide keeps occupying my mind. Of course, we are a group often, and if we hadn't soaped one another's backs I should probably never have noticed he had gone. It's not that I miss him, either.

She knew how much this young man desired her and also that Stiller would on no account take her by force; he was lacking in some quality without which such an action was impossible, and this made her like him all the more. And she liked the fact that this man, who had just been in Spain on some front or other, a man of slim yet powerful build and a head taller than Julika, did not expect the least apology on her part when she had kept him waiting outside the theatre for nearly an hour, but, on the contrary, apologized for his own importun­ity and was already afraid of being a nuisance again. Julika liked all this very much, as I have said; at any rate, she always spoke very kindly of Stiller when she recalled these early times.

Julika is firmly convinced that she kissed him too. Stiller soon stopped, not wanting to be a nuisance to Julika, but nevertheless he was extremely gay during the rest of the walk, breaking off willow rods like a boy and striking his open over­coat with them as he went along.

He made a great effort to listen, occasionally pointing out a particularly beautiful view, which did not distract Julika's attention from her subject; then Stiller felt ashamed of knowing so little about the art of the ballet.

One gets the impression that Stiller, too, clung to her weakness; another woman, a healthy woman, would have demanded strength from him or cast him aside.

Everything about her was now wrong; he nagged at Julika for not taking some dirty plates out with her when she got up from the table to go into the kitchen, and obstinately maintained that she could live on half her energy if she had a little sense, if she would learn a little from him.

 (performed in municipal theatres, above everything, and in any case above Stiller. A few unsuccessful ventures into lesbianism seem not to have altered the situation; ballet remained the only outlet for her sensuality. Other women spare themselves the ballet by becoming mothers instead, by tolerating their hus­bands as necessary procreators and then disregarding them and being happy with their children, whom they prize above all else exactly as a ballet dancer prizes ballet; they can talk about nothing but their children, even when they appear to be talking about other children, and relinquish themselves, apparently, the better to be able to pet themselves in their children, calling it mother love, self-sacrificing devotion, and even child education. Of course, it's pure narcissism. One might say that in the lovely Julika this narcissism of the frigid at least had the advantage of causing no harm to living human beings, but only to art, only to Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov, not to mention Ravel and Stravinsky; her narcissism did not take as its victim a child who would have been dependent on her as its one and only mother. I'm sure Frau Julika Stiller-Tschudy would flare up if I told her I am generally suspicious of women in art; it would be no use assuring her that this did not imply any contempt for women, nor, on the other hand, any contempt for art.

A few unsuccessful ventures into lesbianism seem not to have altered the situation; ballet remained the only outlet for her sensuality. Other women spare themselves the ballet by becoming mothers instead, by tolerating their husbands as necessary procreators and then disregarding them and being happy with their children, whom they prize above all else exactly as a ballet dancer prizes ballet; they can talk about nothing but their children, even when they appear to be talking about other children, and relinquish themselves, apparently, the better to be able to pet themselves in their children, calling it mother love, self-sacrificing devotion, and even child education. Of course, it's pure narcissism. One might say that in the lovely Julika this narcissism of the frigid at least had the advantage of causing no harm to living human beings, but only to art, only to Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov, not to mention Ravel and Stravinsky; her narcissism did not take as its victim a child who would have been dependent on her as its one and only mother.</p>
<p>I'm sure Frau Julika Stiller-Tschudy would flare up if I told her I am generally suspicious of women in art; it would be no use assuring her that this did not imply any contempt for women, nor, on the other hand, any contempt for art.

Oh, it was horrible! Compared with this it was a comfort to be on the stage, to feel thousands of strange eyes on her body, eyes of so many different kinds, the eyes of schoolboys and respectable married men, eyes that took in anything rather than her skill as a dancer; as a matter of fact this worried Julika less than when Stiller, her husband, laid his roughened sculptor's hands on her body.

The young publicity expert was very hard-working, he flew about all over the place, while Julika, of course, still had her rehearsals.

 (Why, for instance, would Stiller never allow Foxli into his studio? And then he wondered why his wife did not come into his studio for months on end - once for almost a whole year -and was disappointed that she took so little interest in his creative work. Julika just didn't know where she could tie Foxli up without having to worry about him - or was she to let Foxli run about the unfamiliar streets, just to give Stiller another opportunity of showing her that his creative work, as he always complained, was making no progress? Stiller really seems to have been the quintessence of hypersensitivity. The fact that for years he had been coming to her ballet rehearsals, where he was allowed to sketch, was only to his own advantage. But what benefit, speaking objectively, could Julika derive from standing about in his dusty studio, where he worked for years on more or less the same undertaking, and perhaps catching a cold? In his egocentricity Stiller was simply closed to all such con­siderations. What did he expect of Julika? His mortification, however politely he kept it to himself, was a burden for poor Julika. The fact that she, the ballerina, never spoke a word during the countless discussions about sculpture that Stiller and his companions often carried on until late at night saddened him; he interpreted it as lack of interest, never thinking that it was simply natural modesty on the part of Julika, who knew nothing about sculpture, quite apart from her whole reserved and shy attitude. When his companions had gone at last, he became rude as well. 'At least you could have made us some gruel,' he said morosely, 'at least you could have done that.' Julika had no intention of becoming his servant. And from the day when the other woman made her appearance his capacity for understanding ran completely dry. Believe it or not, Stiller was indignant because on her veranda it was not he, but Foxli, that Julika missed; and he was honestly surprised because the sick and abandoned Julika did not write him any affectionate letters from Davos, none at all, in fact, except for a note asking Stiller to get her something in the town; Julika simply couldn't write! And later, during the summer, when he himself stopped writing for weeks at a time, he did not shrink in his obtuseness from the cheap excuse that Julika never wrote to him either ... And so on. )

<p>Why, for instance, would Stiller never allow Foxli into his studio? And then he wondered why his wife did not come into his studio for months on end&#x2014;once for almost a whole year&#x2014;and was disappointed that she took so little interest in his creative work. Julika just didn't know where she could tie Foxli up without having to worry about him&#x2014;or was she to let Foxli run about the unfamiliar streets, just to give Stiller another opportunity of showing her that his creative work, as he always complained, was making no progress? Stiller really seems to have been the quintessence of hypersensitivity. The fact that for years he had been coming to her ballet rehearsals, where he was allowed to sketch, was only to his own advantage. But what benefit, speaking objectively, could Julika derive from standing about in his dusty studio, where he worked for years on more or less the same undertaking, and perhaps catching a cold?</p>
<p>In his egocentricity Stiller was simply closed to all such considerations. What did he expect of Julika? His mortification, however politely he kept it to himself, was a burden for poor Julika. The fact that she, the ballerina, never spoke a word during the countless discussions about sculpture that Stiller and his companions often carried on until late at night saddened him; he interpreted it as lack of interest, never thinking that it was simply natural modesty on the part of Julika, who knew nothing about sculpture, quite apart from her whole reserved and shy attitude. When his companions had gone at last, he became rude as well. 'At least you could have made us some gruel,' he said morosely, 'at least you could have done that.' Julika had no intention of becoming his servant. And from the day when the other woman made her appearance his capacity for understanding ran completely dry. Believe it or not, Stiller was indignant because on her veranda it was not he, but Foxli, that Julika missed; and he was honestly surprised because the sick and abandoned Julika did not write him any affectionate letters from Davos, none at all, in fact, except for a note asking Stiller to get her something in the town; Julika simply couldn't write! And later, during the summer, when he himself stopped writing for weeks at a time, he did not shrink in his obtuseness from the cheap excuse that Julika never wrote to him either...</p>
<p>And so on.</p>

'Seriously,' she added - and really meant it in the most friendly spirit - 'I hope you'll realize before it's too late, before you're an old man, Stiller - I hope you'll realize what a wonderful wife you have, what a grand person she is. Quite seriously, Stiller, I hope so with all my heart, for your sake.' But Stiller, it seems, couldn't bear seriousness either; they were in a restaurant at the time; Stiller beckoned the waiter; and while his friend, the children's specialist, went on talking about Julika, he paid, without contributing a word to the sub­ject. And then his only reply was never to have time when this splendid couple, the children's specialist and the veterinary surgeon, invited them over - the cheapest kind of reply. Julika quite rightly defended herself, and took to inviting the children's specialist and the veterinary surgeon over to them; when Stiller came home in the evening and heard from the passage the voices in the flat, he wanted to turn round and leave again. With great difficulty Julika managed to prevent this piece of rudeness; Stiller stayed to dinner, but then he 'had' to go back to his studio. He simply made off.

Julika enjoyed being alive as she had not done for a long time. Davos wasn't so terrible at all, it was a valley much like other valleys, green, peaceful, a bit dull perhaps, a valley with steep woods and flat meadows and here and there a stony rivulet, a landscape, nothing more. Death did not stalk about in the guise of a bony reaper, no, only the grass was mowed, the scent of hay drifted up, and of resin from the nearby wood, somewhere or other they were scattering manure, and in the larches in front of her veranda a mischievous squirrel was doing gymnastics. During the day, perhaps, it was like being on holiday. A neighbour who used to sit on the end of her bed every day for a quarter of an hour, one who was saved, who could go for walks and brought her wild flowers, a young man, younger than Julika, but a veteran of the sanatorium, who used to give a helping hand to newcomers, seems to have cheered Julika up considerably. It was he who brought her books, different from any books Stiller had ever brought, a new world. And what a world! Julika read Plato, the Death of Socrates - difficult, but the young sanatorium veteran helped her without any trace of didacticism, cheerfully casual like those people who pick things up extremely quickly and never imagine we can't understand something, because our brains aren't up to it. He was enchant­ing with his narrow, always rather shrewd face and big eyes, but they were not in the least in love. For her part Julika probably told him about the ballet, and the young sanatorium veteran, who wore suits that had belonged to those who had died, told her a bit about all the people whom Julika heard coughing without ever catching sight of them, no life stories, just tittle-tattle, no indiscretions. Julika was delighted; at the beginning she had been rather put off by his 'frivolous' tone, until she realized that a sharp wit does not rule out deep feeling, but is merely another form of deep feeling, a cleaner, chaster form perhaps. In short, Julika enjoyed these quarters of an hour and missed the young sanatorium veteran profoundly when he failed to appear one day. What was wrong? Nothing at all; a visit from )

A neighbour who used to sit on the end of her bed every day for a quarter of an hour, one who was saved, who could go for walks and brought her wild flowers, a young man, younger than Julika, but a veteran of the sanatorium, who used to give a helping hand to newcomers, seems to have cheered Julika up considerably. It was he who brought her books, different from any books Stiller had ever brought, a new world. And what a world! Julika read Plato, the Death of Socrates&#x2014;difficult, but the young sanatorium veteran helped her without any trace of didacticism, cheerfully casual like those people who pick things up extremely quickly and never imagine we can't understand something, because our brains aren't up to it. He was enchanting with his narrow, always rather shrewd face and big eyes, but they were not in the least in love. For her part Julika probably told him about the ballet, and the young sanatorium veteran, who wore suits that had belonged to those who had died, told her a bit about all the people whom Julika heard coughing without ever catching sight of them, no life stories, just tittle-tattle, no indiscretions. Julika was delighted; at the beginning she had been rather put off by his 'frivolous' tone, until she realized that a sharp wit does not rule out deep feeling, but is merely another form of deep feeling, a cleaner, chaster form perhaps.</p>
<p>In short, Julika enjoyed these quarters of an hour and missed the young sanatorium veteran profoundly when he failed to appear one day. What was wrong? Nothing at all; a visit from <!--leaf100:

 (his family, nothing more. The next day he came back and gave Julika an explanation of an X-ray photograph. His own? He didn't answer this question, showed her what is called a 'shadow', and gradually led Julika to find a skeleton like this beautiful, to look at it as a drawing, to be enchanted by the transparency of the heart, which was not to be seen, and fascin­ated by the mysterious clouds between ribs and spine; if you looked at it long enough it was positively seething with forms, all of them lost in a dreamlike twilight. Finally, when the rascal revealed that it was she personally, Frau Julika Stiller-Tschudy, illumined by the X-rays, she was no longer shocked. How did he get hold of it? Stole it yesterday, while waiting for the doctor; mischievous pranks were called for in the sanatorium, but per haps elsewhere too. Julika couldn't help thinking of Stiller. Naturally these visits at the end of her bed interested her more than Stiller's dutifully regular letters, which, as Julika felt very strongly, illumined nothing, just the opposite. His letters were a voluble concealment. What could Julika have answered? The letters had only one good result; the mere sight of them pacified the head physician and the nurse. The fact was, they found it odd, putting it mildly, very odd that Herr Stiller never visited his wife. Julika had to speak up in his defence. 'My husband will come,' she said frequently. 'About time,' said the head physician, 'otherwise I'll send the gentleman a list of trains, in case he hasn't got a timetable!...' Everyone was very fond of Frau Julika and during the day, especially when the weather was fine, the time passed almost without strain. The young sanatorium veteran, a student from a Catholic seminary, was really a gift from heaven. Julika would never have believed that so much culture and so much boyish­ness could be found together. He was the most learned man Julika had ever spoken to, and often enough she felt like an illiterate; but on the other hand like a mature woman; for he was a boy, as I have said. Anyhow, Julika greatly enjoyed his conversation, his knowledge, and his boyishness at the foot of her bed. If you asked him something he didn't know, he was delighted, just like Foxli when you threw a stone or a fir-cone for him to run after. A few days later he would come back knowing where and what you could read on the subject. He )

 (As far as Landquart, the station where she had to change, everything went off as though Julika were on an ordinary journey, not in flight; nobody stopped Julika, nobody stared at her, or at least no more than people always did stare at her because of her beautiful hair. A short halt at Klosters, about mid way, seemed to her endless, as any four-minute wait before a closed barrier is bound to seem like eternity to a fugitive. Julika hid behind a newspaper, but she was terrified every time anyone passed through her second-class compartment. The little train remained stationary; whyever were they stopping so long? Julika couldn't understand why no one recognized her, no one tapped her on the shoulder and said, 'What's all this about, my dear Julika, what's all this about?' Uninitiated in the mysteries of the railway system, Julika could only suppose that this long halt was due to a call from the sanatorium and that they were searching for her, going from carriage to carriage looking for the unfortunate fugitive. Julika pulled her hanging coat down over her face, as people do who want to sleep in a train. Someone sat opposite her, a gentleman; she could see by his shoes. Her head physician? In her mind's eye she could already see his compassionate smile, his friendly but inexorable, 'Frau Julika, Frau Julika, we'd better drop this little scheme.' At last, when the little train started to move off, Julika had to find out who it was that had caught her; she pushed her overcoat camouflage a little to one side, as though she urgently needed to look at the scenery. It was a German gentleman, who, the moment he saw Julika's red hair, politely took his cigar out of his mouth and inquired whether his smoke was inconveniencing her. Did he think Julika was a lung patient? 'Oh, not at all, not at all,' said Julika with rather gauche overemphasis, 'please don't mind me.' Stupidly enough she had taken a seat in a smoker. Julika, the fugitive, couldn't even indulge in the sort of pleasant light conversation which the German gentleman, with­out any effort, just started quite naturally, no, she could already hear in imagination the pointless, but in such conversations )

<break type="graphic"/>
<p align="left">As far as Landquart, the station where she had to change, everything went off as though Julika were on an ordinary journey, not in flight; nobody stopped Julika, nobody stared at her, or at least no more than people always did stare at her because of her beautiful hair. A short halt at Klosters, about mid way, seemed to her endless, as any four-minute wait before a closed barrier is bound to seem like eternity to a fugitive. Julika hid behind a newspaper, but she was terrified every time anyone passed through her second-class compartment. The little train remained stationary; whyever were they stopping so long? Julika couldn't understand why no one recognized her, no one tapped her on the shoulder and said, 'What's all this about, my dear Julika, what's all this about?' Uninitiated in the mysteries of the railway system, Julika could only suppose that this long halt was due to a call from the sanatorium and that they were searching for her, going from carriage to carriage looking for the unfortunate fugitive. Julika pulled her hanging coat down over her face, as people do who want to sleep in a train. Someone sat opposite her, a gentleman; she could see by his shoes. Her head physician? In her mind's eye she could already see his compassionate smile, his friendly but inexorable, 'Frau Julika, Frau Julika, we'd better drop this little scheme.'</p>
<p>At last, when the little train started to move off, Julika had to find out who it was that had caught her; she pushed her overcoat camouflage a little to one side, as though she urgently needed to look at the scenery. It was a German gentleman, who, the moment he saw Julika's red hair, politely took his cigar out of his mouth and inquired whether his smoke was inconveniencing her. Did he think Julika was a lung patient? 'Oh, not at all, not at all,' said Julika with rather gauche overemphasis, 'please don't mind me.' Stupidly enough she had taken a seat in a smoker. Julika, the fugitive, couldn't even indulge in the sort of pleasant light conversation which the German gentleman, without any effort, just started quite naturally, no, she could already hear in imagination the pointless, but in such conversations <!--leaf119:

The note was simply grotesque; for there was not a trace of bad conscience to be seen in these lines, merciful heaven, every word in the note was imbued with shameless egocentricity and a cynical self-righteousness.

He had eight minutes in which to do it. Instead he let them reach his bank waiting for the others to open fire, in other words, ready to be shot. To avoid giving away their presence, the Franco Spaniards did not shoot either, but disarmed young Stiller, threw his Russian gun into the Tajo, tied him up with his own braces and left him lying in the gorse, where he was found two days later by his own side, faint with thirst.

Now, of course, Stiller had to interfere, to fill in the gaps and finish the story.

He called it a victory for humanity, a victory of concrete experience over ideological rigidity and so on; he found all sorts of words for it. No one contradicted this flattering interpretation, and Stiller himself, visibly rather ill at ease, had for his part no desire whatever to delve deeper into this story; he was all in favour of more life and gaiety, uncorked the next bottle and made sure in his charming way that everybody had something to drink, including the lovely Julika in the corner, who on this first visit to the studio, looked round with great big beautiful eyes, without drinking much, without saying any­thing; her contribution, as so often, was her glorious hair with its reddish glow. Stiller's anecdote, it seems, was always a great success. Later, when she was friendly with Stiller and then married to him, Julika had to listen to it very often. It was one of the duties of a loving wife not to yawn and not to interrupt when her husband came out with his hit number again. It was a hit number, Stiller with his ferry on the Tajo. Only the Communists wrinkled their noses when the victory of humanity over ideology was talked about, but they kept quiet out of friendship for Stiller; at most they asked the listeners how they would feel about a victory of humanity over ideology if it didn't happen to concern Fascists. But such conversations had nothing further to do with Stiller. And anyway, the Communists became rarer and rarer - at least among Stiller's acquaintances. In all other company Stiller always emerged with honour from his Spanish anecdote. Why did he tell it so often? And in any case, Julika still can't understand why Stiller, her missing husband, suddenly talked about a 'Spanish defeat' on the oc­casion of their last meeting at Davos. Why defeat? Julika had no explanation for this. Hadn't he demanded of Julika for years that she should find his behaviour in Spain magnificent? And now it was suddenly a defeat, a thing that weighed in the scales as the beginning of all evil, as a curse, an ill omen, by which Stiller also explained the unhappiness of their marriage. Why? )

It was one of the duties of a loving wife not to yawn and not to interrupt when her husband came out with his hit number again. It was a hit number, Stiller with his ferry on the Tajo. Only the Communists wrinkled their noses when the victory of humanity over ideology was talked about, but they kept quiet out of friendship for Stiller; at most they asked the listeners how they would feel about a victory of humanity over ideology if it didn't happen to concern Fascists. But such conversations had nothing further to do with Stiller. And anyway, the Communists became rarer and rarer&#x2014;at least among Stiller's acquaintances.</p>
<p>In all other company Stiller always emerged with honour from his Spanish anecdote. Why did he tell it so often? And in any case, Julika still can't understand why Stiller, her missing husband, suddenly talked about a 'Spanish defeat' on the occasion of their last meeting at Davos. Why defeat? Julika had no explanation for this. Hadn't he demanded of Julika for years that she should find his behaviour in Spain magnificent? And now it was suddenly a defeat, a thing that weighed in the scales as the beginning of all evil, as a curse, an ill omen, by which Stiller also explained the unhappiness of their marriage. Why?</p>

There is a satanic quality about feminine forgiveness, my dear, which is alien to you, of course, anything of that kind is alien to you; I just took it like that because I'm so hypersensitive, and you can perish of hypersensitivity just as well as of tuberculosis.

Of course you knew from the start that you would collapse some­where along the line, but you no longer shrink from paying any price to make sure of my bad conscience. You're mistaken! But the terrible thing is that in a different sense it's really my fault you're in this sanatorium. But there you've got nothing more to forgive me. I often think, if I hadn't made you my test the idea of fettering me with your ill health would never have occurred to you, and we should have loved each other in a natural manner, I don't know, or parted in a natural manner. You ought to have met a man who had no guilty conscience and yet plenty of patience, free patience, anyhow a man who could only be won and held by natural love.

Seriously, that was a mistake that can never be made good now; a mistake, of that I'm convinced. How much it would have spared us both! For instance, your ill-fated journey to Landquart, I believe. Of course you knew from the start that you would collapse somewhere along the line, but you no longer shrink from paying any price to make sure of my bad conscience. You're mistaken! But the terrible thing is that in a different sense it's really my fault you're in this sanatorium. But there you've got nothing more to forgive me. I often think, if I hadn't made you my test the idea of fettering me with your ill health would never have occurred to you, and we should have loved each other in a natural manner, I don't know, or parted in a natural manner. You ought to have met a man who had no guilty conscience and yet plenty of patience, free patience, anyhow a man who could only be won and held by natural love. Who knows, my dear Julika, how healthy you might have been&#x2014;all the time...'</p>

'You've made an image of me, that's quite clear,, a complete and final image, and there's an end of it. You just won't see me any other way, 1 can feel that. Aren't I right?' Stiller lit a cigarette.

Every image is a sin. All those things you've been saying are exactly the oppo­site of love, you know. I don't know whether you realize that. When you love someone you leave every possibility open to them, and in spite of all the memories of the past you are ready to be surprised, again and again surprised, at how different they are, how various, not a finished image such as you have made of your Julika. I can only tell you, it's not like that. You always talk yourself into believing things - Thou shalt not make unto thee an image of me! That's the only answer I can give you.' Stiller smoked away to himself. 'Where did you get all that from?' was all he asked. It was impossible to talk to Stiller any more, it seems he only listened to himself. He had come from Pontresina with the fixed deter­mination to tear everything to the ground. 'Love?' he laughed, 'let's not talk about love, not in our case, and not about fidelity either - you too would probably have left me long ago, Julika, you never lacked opportunities, I know, merely confidence in your ability to hold a real man. Let's be frank. Our comparative fidelity was fear of defeat at the hands of another partner, such as I have suffered now, nothing else. Don't let's kid ourselves. It's all over now between us also. I think, Julika, we're seeing one another for the last time.' Julika wept. 'It's horrible,' remarked Stiller very soberly, 'that it has to be in this sanatorium. You're by no means past the crisis, your head physician tells me.

 ('Here,' I said, 'that's the proper stuff.' Later I had to look down the barrel of a Swiss rifle. They compelled me. For some strange reason I let them compel me. I wonder why. I looked into the foreign rifle as though it were a telescope, but I couldn't see anything, a small hole full of grey light, nothing else. And all the time they were waiting for me to sink through the concrete floor with shame. A little mirror was attached. 'Can you see anything?' I saw rust, and as I hadn't asked how much the barrel of a Swiss rifle cost I wasn't in the least interested in the young officer's lecture, to which I listened out of politeness. I hadn't dreamed of buying a Swiss rifle. A revolver, yes, or a sub­machine-gun; but what could I do with a rifle as long as a walking-stick? The young liuetenant seemed somehow ill at ease, as though he thought I might also be an educated man; he kept on saying: 'I don't have to explain that to you.' Then, purely from a sense of duty, as though he himself were being put through an examination by the two storekeepers, he explained it just the same, embarrassing though he found it. Somehow I had the feeling he was trying to show me that he too had higher interests, but the only way he could do so in this quartermaster's hut was now and then to look out of the window at the pouring rain - while the two storekeepers, who now regarded me with ever growing hate, were not prevented by my manifest indifference from laying on the table everything they considered necessary for waging war. To wit: two brushes, knife and fork, a reel with field-grey thread, leather-soap, a very exact number of buttons, each one of them bearing the Swiss cross, a mess tin, a water-bottle, of which the cork ought not to stink, shoes laces, a paint brush with a case, a steel helmet, a so-called tie, a bayonet with a sheath, as well as two needles, which the missing Stiller had also irresponsibly allowed to rust. In short, there was a whole table full of stuff, at which I stared in amaze­ment, though keeping my hands in my trouser pockets. 'I don't need to give you a lecture,' said the young lieutenant. 'You know that you will have to pay for the damage.' 'I?' I laughed. 'Why ever should I?' )

 ('Who else do you think is going to?' I didn't get a chance to speak. I even had to put on their missing man's battledress tunic. I simply didn't get a chance to speak; therein lay part of their power, and to my surprise I actually knuckled under, although reluctantly. It didn't occur to them to hold the tunic for me, and when I couldn't find the attachment on the collar they just exclaimed, 'Jump to it.' Nor did they pay any heed to my innocent remark that in a tunic like this a soldier would be exhausted before he ever caught a glimpse of the enemy. I had to turn round like a tailor's dummy. 'You've grown thinner,' affirmed the young lieutenant, who was seeing me for the first time in his life. 'It's baggy every­where.' In the meantime one of the storekeepers had stepped over to a rack and dragged out another tunic, which he threw to me: 'Try this one?' 'What for?' I asked. Again I received no answer, but only another tunic of a different size and a lecture from the young officer: up to the age of forty-eight I was a member of the Swiss militia, and I was liable for military service until the end of my sixtieth year; of course I was entitled to go abroad, but it was my duty first to ask the State for leave and to report my depar­ture to the local command, as laid down in standing orders; furthermore, in the event of such leave being granted, the military equipment issued to every male Swiss citizen should not be left lying about in a loft, but handed in, so that the quartermaster's men could guard it from moths; and further­more, on arriving in a foreign country it was my duty to report immediately to the nearest Swiss legation, so that I should not evade the military tax, and also to report my departure from there and so on ... 'My compliments on the efficiency of your Swiss organiza­tion, Lieutenant,' I said. 'But as far as I'm concerned - ' They didn't let me go on. There was only one idea in their three heads: Stiller must be in fighting trim. I couldn't escape trying on a pair of army boots as well - first-class goods, inci­dentally.

In view of their rage, which unfortunately they let out on the helmet and mess tin, I refrained from justifying myself. They simply hadn't given me a chance to speak. Their anger was understandable; for now I wasn't allowed to touch anything, neither the rifle nor the army boots, which latter I should have been glad to keep, and they had to repack the whole kitbag themselves. I merely said, 'Sorry!' But the young lieutenant found it very embarrassing; he felt obliged to chat with me for a while. He had a lively interest in America. He apologized several times; it upset him that a thing of this sort should have happened to an American in Switzerland, and he said good-bye to me with a military salute.

 (window open for me, while the other gave me a light, and the only thing missing was an inquiry as to where they could drive me. Wilfried Stiller, the brother, is apparently very disappointed because I haven't answered his brotherly letter. I shall do so as soon as I have a moment to spare. Today, Sunday, Knobel comes to see me out of uniform, in a white shirt and a tie, to hear about my fourth murder. I'm not in the mood. But I can't get out of it. 'That was in Texas,' I say. 'While I was still working as a cowboy.' 'You were a cowboy too?' 'Why not?' 'Well I'm damned.' So I tell him how one summer morning on the prairie, feeling a bit fed up with my everyday life as a cowboy, I rode further than usual, further than necessary. I was lost in thought, so to speak (the nature of my thoughts is of no interest to my listener) and with no special aim. I even broke into a trot. After about five hours, during which time I had scarcely looked back, I came to the red rocks I had been seeing for weeks on the horizon of the plain. I jumped down from my black horse, tied it to a stunted oak and scrambled to a higher level, enticed by the ever-widening view over the endless plane that now lay behind me, over a green and silver-grey ocean of land. It was a hot, humming noontide, I was almost dying of thirst. I looked for a spring, but in vain, for the whole region was made up of lime­stone, and suddenly, as I was tramping with my boots through the dry and sometimes prickly scrub, I suddenly found myself standing on the edge of an abyss, a crack in the rock, that looked pretty much like the jaws of a shark, but it was vast and as black as night. None of my comrades had ever talked about this cave. It was pure chance that I had discovered the opening, which is only visible from right up close, in the midst of this hilly wilder­ness. Perhaps there was water here! It was deathly silent, to 1)

<p align="left">Today, Sunday, Knobel comes to see me out of uniform, in a white shirt and a tie, to hear about my fourth murder. I'm not in the mood. But I can't get out of it.</p>
<p>'That was in Texas,' I say. 'While I was still working as a cowboy.'</p>
<p>'You were a cowboy too?'</p>
<p>'Why not?'</p>
<p>'Well I'm damned.'</p>
<p>So I tell him how one summer morning on the prairie, feeling a bit fed up with my everyday life as a cowboy, I rode further than usual, further than necessary. I was lost in thought, so to speak (the nature of my thoughts is of no interest to my listener) and with no special aim. I even broke into a trot. After about five hours, during which time I had scarcely looked back, I came to the red rocks I had been seeing for weeks on the horizon of the plain. I jumped down from my black horse, tied it to a stunted oak and scrambled to a higher level, enticed by the ever-widening view over the endless plane that now lay behind me, over a green and silver-grey ocean of land. It was a hot, humming noontide, I was almost dying of thirst. I looked for a spring, but in vain, for the whole region was made up of limestone, and suddenly, as I was tramping with my boots through the dry and sometimes prickly scrub, I suddenly found myself standing on the edge of an abyss, a crack in the rock, that looked pretty much like the jaws of a shark, but it was vast and as black as night. None of my comrades had ever talked about this cave. It was pure chance that I had discovered the opening, which is only visible from right up close, in the midst of this hilly wilderness. Perhaps there was water here! It was deathly silent, to <!--leaf138: 
type:bold
 (be sure, but I shall never forget how I took the first few steps, simply to satisfy my curiosity, into the shadowy abyss, cautiously, holding on to the shrub nearest the opening, and peered with neck outstretched into the yawning depths, blinded by the darkness. No one was ordering me to climb down into this cavern; nevertheless, I was very uneasy and I couldn't get my discovery out of my mind. A stone broke loose under my boot and bounced merrily down, echoing further and further away and didn't stop echoing until, cowboy though I was, I turned pale. I really didn't know if I could still hear the stone bouncing, or was I only imagining it? I could scarcely breathe for fright, but I forced myself not to run away. I could hear my heart pounding, otherwise there was a,deathly silence. Then I shouted loudly: Hallo? And seized by groundless terror, as though it wasn't my own voice, I clambered up between the prickly bushes, hurriedly, as though in danger of being snapped up by a dragon, chased by the echo, into the sunshine, where I laughed at myself. Or at least I tried to laugh at myself. Because here, in the midday sun, all I could hear was the familiar hum of insects, the rustle of the tall grass in the wind, and I looked out over the Texas plain, that ocean of land which at the time I saw every day. And yet I had the uncanny feeling that I could still hear the bouncing stone. It was night by the time I got back to the ranch. I excused myself with some impudent lie. But I didn't say a word about the cave, not even to Jim, my best friend, who slept alongside me; he tugged at my hammock to find out where I had really been all day, and I left him green with envy in the belief that somewhere in that almost uninhabited plain (for months on end you met only men, horses and cattle) I had found an easy-going girl. Jim gave me a dig in the ribs, the sign of a hearty delight in my good fortune and an equally hearty jealousy at the same time. But, as I said, I didn't give away my cave. Our work on the ranch was strenuous, there were only a few of us, and one of those was ill; I had to wait another two weeks for my next day off. Naturally, I rode off at first light (in a wide arc so that no one should see where I was going) to my cavern, equipped with a lantern in order to be able to penetrate the darkness, ready for )

Breathless with fright at the abyss yawning at my feet, I didn't dare move. Quite simply: there was no longer any floor for my light to fall on. I looked up towards the mouth of the cave, to­wards the daylight, but meanwhile night had fallen over the earth too; I saw a few stars, a few sparks gleaming dully in the infinite distance, all around the close blackness of the rock, and remembering the bouncing stone whose echo had died away in ever increasing depths, I didn't dare even to walk back the way I had come; every step, it seemed to me, meant a fall to death.

In time, however (I was kneeling at the edge of the hole, as I said, hearing only my heart beating), I could make out a cavern, an equally large space not reminiscent of Notre Dame but of dreams, a world that was suddenly so different, not rocks with bats on them, but a fairy-tale cave with hundreds and hundreds of columns of glistening stalagmite. That was my first discovery. For someone who could climb it would not be impossible to clamber down into this fairy tale. But how would I get back up again? But I knew one thing: if I turned back now I should rue and regret it all my life. My anxiety turned into recklessness.

Enticed by a maze whichever way I shone my light, I tramped along behind my lantern, half blissful as though I had reached the goal of all my desires, and half hor­rified, as though I were already lost, condemned as the price for my amazement, never to return to earth, never again to see the sun, the stars of which I had just caught a glimpse or even the )

And the deeper you descend the more luxuriant the shapes that rise from the floors of the caves, like coral; you tramp through forests of snow-covered firs, then again you see a pagoda, a goblin or an extinct fountain from Versailles, according to the angle at which you look at it, a strange Arcadia of the dead, a Hades such as Orpheus entered; there is no lack of stone ladies who, it seems, are slowly being swallowed up by their pleated veils, by veils of amber, never to be freed again by any human love, and in a greenish pool something like waterlilies are blossoming, but they too are stone of course, everything is stone. Again and again there are dark fissures that a lantern cannot light up; you drop a stone into them and shiver with horror long after its bouncing has stopped, knowing there is no <!--leaf144:

I could only carry my friend as far as I could go without having to climb, that is to say not upwards, not up to the surface. I also took a drink and said: Just play it cool, Jim, we'll get you up to the top somehow. We examined his ankle and treated it too with alcohol; perhaps it wasn't broken but only sprained. Despite his pain and my commonsense, Jim insisted on immediately putting on his boot again. Was he seriously afraid I should suddenly leave him in the lurch? We had both hardly slept up to now; the rest and the liquor made us feel it.

So, for I don't know how many hours, we held each other in check, chatting about our plans up there on the green earth; Jim was drawn to the city, especially New York, and the women he had missed for so long on our ranch, and I (during those hours) was attracted by the life of a gardener, if possible in a fertile region. What on earth were we doing in this godforsaken darkness? Our two lanterns were still alight. Jim was right: it's a waste, an idiotic waste. Why didn't he put his out? Because he distrusted me, because, although he kept on talking about our friendship, he considered it altogether possible that I might abandon him, my only friend at the time, to the deadly darkness. I enquired about the state of his pain, his hunger, his thirst.

I said: Then put out your lantern. He said: We haven't time, Jim, we must get moving, we must give it a try.

I put the knapsack containing my last piece of mutton under my cheek with the strap round my right hand, so that I should wake if Jim tried to steal my mutton. When I woke I found he had smashed my lantern in order, as he said, to put an end to this idiotic waste. At the same time he asked me for half my remaining mutton. He wailed: You can't let me die of hunger! Ahead of us, lit up by our single lantern, gleamed the almost vertical rock wall, the difficult bit which, however, I had once overcome all on my own.

 (My second afternoon out on bail with Julika. The moment I saw her again I received the vivid impression: This isn't she! This woman has nothing to do with the dreary story I have partially recorded during the last few days, nothing at all. There are two different Julikas. It isn't her story at all. And so on. 'You,' she asked me several times, 'what's the matter with you? Why do you look at me like that all the time?' Today she was more at ease than I. My suggestion that we should hire a sailing boat delighted her. We went along arm in arm. I didn't know what to talk about, and was glad to be able to busy myself with the halyards and the rudder, while Frau Julika Stiller-Tschudy, dressed today in a banana-yellow frock - after some anxiety as she jumped into the rocking boat and some concern as to where she could stow her white handbag and her butterfly-like Paris hat without getting them dirty or damaged - sat on the other seat in charming indolence, propped up by her outstretched arms. Julika had only to change seats when I put the boat about. Then she abandoned herself to repose again and her lustrous hair to the wind. How different she was! Out there on the lake, whose hilly shores, packed almost solid with houses and always very close, were lost in an autumnal haze, giving one a certain sense of distance, we were more or less alone together for the first time. Did she realize the fact? Anyhow, we didn't have to reckon with the warder, my good Knobel, appearing at any moment with the ash tray ... Now (back in my cell) I try in vain to see her laughing face; I only know very vividly that whenever it laughs I want to take it in both hands like a gift from heaven that cannot be grasped with the hands, but only believed, and then I have the alert, sober feeling: there is nothing that could not be melted away in this laughter. In a context which I forget, she said: 'The trouble is that when I'm all by myself and think about everything, alone, I can't laugh about it, or if I do it's such an angry and bitter laugh that later on I howl over the very things I laughed about.'

 ((Gunner Stiller) without much ceremony - understand? I stand stiffly to attention, with rifle at the shoulder, and have under­stood that the Swiss captain, who has a perfect right to do so, hates Stiller for some reason and, thanks to the obedience we have just sworn to the fatherland, can kill me: without much ceremony - with a command ... P.S. When I mentioned this dream casually to my counsel, he was visibly indignant. We talked about the army. It wasn't enough for him that, for the sake of peace (peace between my counsel and me), I accepted it as a necessary evil. The army seems to be sacred, even in Switzerland, and my counsel could not tolerate someone dreaming badly about it. In reality, he asserted, no Swiss officer could ever utter such an unseemly, such a positively criminal threat. 'I guarantee that,' he said with the pride of a Swiss officer, a major I think, 'I guarantee that,' he said several times. Answered Herr Wilfried Stiller, brother of the missing man -unfortunately again forgot to make a copy - roughly as follows: 'Your cordial letter to your missing brother moved me deeply, dear Herr Stiller, it reminded me df my mother, so that I too shed tears, and I apologize for not having replied to it sooner. My life is one single act of neglect. I am not annoyed that you do not ask me about it, on the contrary, I am grateful to you for this, as for your brotherly invitation; it reminds me of my brother and of the fact that I also neglected my brother. We rarely had a quarrel, and never a long or important one, for we never had anything important to do with one another, it seems to me; we used to go on walking tours together, simply because we were brothers, and spend peaceful nights under canvas and hours round the camp-fire without speaking a word. Why did I also neglect my brother?

'No.' The Bowery, originally a Dutch name, is a district into which even the police no longer venture, fields of the lost, though right in the middle of Manhattan; you go round the marble corner of a palatial law-court and after a hundred paces you are in the fields of the lost, of drunkards, failures, degenerates of all kinds, people on whom life itself has passed judgement. There's no need even to put them in prison; no one who has landed in the Bowery ever gets out again.

In addition to the hat he wore a tie, a whitish shirt, and a black jacket but that was all; the lower half of his body was stark naked. On his thin, greyish-purple old man's legs he had sock-suspenders and shoes. He was obviously drunk. He swore, fell down, and crawled along the icy roadway; a car sped past with its headlights blazing, thank God without running over him.

 ('My stepfather,' I said. 'All the same - ' But even then, when he can't believe me, my public prose­cutor is a great deal nicer than my counsel; he doesn't become indignant if our conceptions of truth don't always agree. He tapped himself a cigarette and said: 'Of course, my wife didn't get to know districts like that.' He's always talking about his wife. 'Do you know Fire Island?' 'Yes,' I asked, 'why?' 'It's supposed to be very pretty, according to my wife, all the country round New York in fact.' 'Very pretty.' 'Unfortunately my wife didn't have a car of her own,' he declared, 'but she often used to drive out - with friends, as far as I know.' 'One has to do that,' I said. 'Did you have your own car?' 'I?' I laughed. 'No.' Somehow this statement seemed to please him, to relieve him, to cheer him up and free him from some idea which I couldn't quite guess. In summer New York is unbearable, no question, and anyone who can do so gets out as soon as he's free. For instance, on Sundays hundreds of thousands of cars drive out over Washington Bridge, three abreast, an army of city-dwellers urgently seeking nature.

<p>But even then, when he can't believe me, my public prosecutor is a great deal nicer than my counsel; he doesn't become indignant if our conceptions of truth don't always agree.</p>
<p>He tapped himself a cigarette and said:</p>
<p>'Of course, my wife didn't get to know districts like that.'</p>
<p>He's always talking about his wife.</p>
<p>'Do you know Fire Island?'</p>
<p>'Yes,' I asked, 'why?'</p>
<p>'It's supposed to be very pretty, according to my wife, all the country round New York in fact.'</p>
<p>'Very pretty.'</p>
<p>'Unfortunately my wife didn't have a car of her own,' he declared, 'but she often used to drive out&#x2014;with friends, as far as I know.'</p>
<p>'One has to do that,' I said.</p>
<p>'Did you have your own car?'</p>
<p>'I?' I laughed. 'No.'</p>
<p>Somehow this statement seemed to please him, to relieve him, to cheer him up and free him from some idea which I couldn't quite guess. In summer New York is unbearable, no question, and anyone who can do so gets out as soon as he's free. For instance, on Sundays hundreds of thousands of cars drive out over Washington Bridge, three abreast, an army of city-dwellers urgently seeking nature.

 (.harbour, it doesn't prove that I've been there. We live in an age of reproduction. Most of what makes up our personal picture of the world we have never seen with our own eyes - or rather, we've seen it with our own eyes, but not on the spot: our knowledge comes to us from a distance, we are televiewers, telehearers, teieknowers. One need never have left this little town to have Hitler's voice still ringing in one's ears, to have seen the Shah of Persia from a distance of three yards, and to know how the monsoon howls over the Himalayas or what it looks like six hundred fathoms beneath the sea. Anyone can know these things nowadays. Does it mean I have ever been to the bottom of the sea? Or even (like the Swiss) almost up Mount Everest? And it's just the same with the inner life of man. Anyone can know about it nowadays. How the devil am I to prove to my counsel that I don't know my murderous impulses through C. G. Jung, jealousy through Marcel Proust, Spain through Hemingway, Paris through Ernst Jtinger, Switzerland through Mark Twain, Mexico through Graham Greene, my fear of death through Bernanos, inability ever to reach my destination through Kafka, and all sorts of other things through Thomas Mann? It's true, you need never have read these authorities, you can absorb them through your friends who also live all their experiences second-hand. What an age! It means nothing any more to have seen sword-fish, to have loved a mulatto girl, it could all have happened during a matinee performance of a documentary film; and as for having thoughts - good heavens, it's already a rarity in this age to meet a mind that's moulded on one particular model, it's a sign of personality if someone sees the world with Heidegger and only with Heidegger; the rest of us swim in a cocktail containing pretty well everything and mixed in the most elegant manner by Eliot; we know our way about everywhere and, as I have said, not even our accounts of the visible world mean anything; there's no)

We live in an age of reproduction. Most of what makes up our personal picture of the world we have never seen with our own eyes&#x2014;or rather, we've seen it with our own eyes, but not on the spot: our knowledge comes to us from a distance, we are televiewers, telehearers, teleknowers. One need never have left this little town to have Hitler's voice still ringing in one's ears, to have seen the Shah of Persia from a distance of three yards, and to know how the monsoon howls over the Himalayas or what it looks like six hundred fathoms beneath the sea. Anyone can know these things nowadays. Does it mean I have ever been to the bottom of the sea? Or even (like the Swiss) almost up Mount Everest?</p>
<p>And it's just the same with the inner life of man. Anyone can know about it nowadays. How the devil am I to prove to my counsel that I don't know my murderous impulses through C. G. Jung, jealousy through Marcel Proust, Spain through Hemingway, Paris through Ernst Jiinger, Switzerland through Mark Twain, Mexico through Graham Greene, my fear of death through Bernanos, inability ever to reach my destination through Kafka, and all sorts of other things through Thomas Mann? It's true, you need never have read these authorities, you can absorb them through your friends who also live all their experiences second-hand.</p>
<p>What an age! It means nothing any more to have seen swordfish, to have loved a mulatto girl, it could all have happened during a matin&#xE9;e performance of a documentary film; and as for having thoughts&#x2014;good heavens, it's already a rarity in this age to meet a mind that's moulded on one particular model, it's a sign of personality if someone sees the world with Heidegger and only with Heidegger; the rest of us swim in a cocktail containing pretty well everything and mixed in the most elegant manner by Eliot; we know our way about everywhere and, as I have said, not even our accounts of the visible world mean anything; there's no <emph type="2">terra incognita</emph> nowadays (except Russia). So what's the point of telling all these stories? It doesn't mean you've been there. My counsel is right. And yet&mdash;</p>
<p>I swear:</p>
<p>There was a mulatto named Florence, a docker's daughter, I <!--leaf163:

 (saw her every day and occasionally talked to her over the fence, a fence made of tar barrels and overgrown with brambles that kept us well apart. There was Florence with her gazelle-like walk. I dreamt about her, certainly, the wildest dreams; but nevertheless she was there next morning in the flesh. There was a tapping of high-heeled shoes on the wooden porch, and I immediately looked out through the holes in the curtains of my shingle hut hoping to see Florence; I was generally too late. But then I waited until she came out again with a bucket, emptied the frothy contents against my fence, and nodded; for at this moment I rushed impetuously out into the garden. She said, 'Hallo', and I said, 'Hallo.' And I daren't describe her white smile in her brown face. People are familiar with this smile too from documentary films, from the newspapers, and even from a variety show in this very town, I know, and her singular voice can be heard on gramophone records, almost her voice ... Then, as I 'happened' to be in the garden, Florence would ask, 'How's your cat?' The fact was that once, months ago, I had asked Florence after my hated cat, the agile beast which I once shut up in a refrigerator because of its reproachful spitting; I have referred to the incident already. Of course Florence knew nothing about this refrigerator intermezzo, but she must have guessed at my inner conflict with this black cat (she was grey, her name was Little Grey, but at night outside my window she was black) and thought I ought to show her (the cat) more love. But it was Florence I loved and the cat was perfectly well aware of the fact. So was Florence, in all probability... When Florence was not at home and I could not hear her singular voice, I used to go round the district from bar to bar looking for her. Once I actually found her. Everyone knows how Negroes dance. Her partner at the moment was a U.S. Army sergeant. The couple danced so well that a circle of spectators formed round them, and the enthu­siasts in the circle began to clap their hands in an ever faster rhythm, and finally in a frenzy. The U.S. Army sergeant - a tall fellow with the slender hips of a lion, with two legs of rubber, with the half-open mouth of pleasure and the sightless eyes of ecstasy, a fellow who had the chest and shoulders of a Michel­angelo slave - reached the end of his strength; Florence danced )

Florence was still dancing alone when another came and spun her around, scarcely touching her fingers, circled around her, then took hold of her with the palm of his hand and swung her almost to the parquet floor, and then picked her up by the waist and lifted her so that her head almost struck the low ceiling; as she was poised in mid-air Florence made such a regal gesture with her arms, a gesture of such joyful triumph, that I felt like a cripple with my inexpressive white man's body; then she landed on the parquet floor as weightless as a bird. Now there was nothing to be heard but a dull jungle drumming, a soundless tremor, a kind of frenzied silence, while she went on dancing. A third partner was used up, and a fourth. Then suddenly, with­out being in the least exhausted, Florence laughed and stopped. As unselfconsciously as a child, a very happy child, who has been allowed on the roundabout and is still beaming with pleasure, she made her way out between the little tables, no doubt to powder her nose, and saw me. 'Hallo,' she said, 'Hallo'; she even added, 'Nice to see you,' and it almost consoled me for the bitter-sweetness of my confusion. For I knew very well that I could never content this girl. This filled me with all the greater longing. And then, one hot Sunday, I heard the long-missed tapping of her high-heeled shoes again and dodged behind the curtains.

It may be, too, that he expected to gain some advantage from crossing the frontier. The further the better! So he was sitting in the night train, a gentleman without any luggage, alone in his second-class compartment. The train stopped at daybreak at Milan, in an empty station.

So he was sitting in the night train, a gentleman without any luggage, alone in his second-class compartment. The train stopped at daybreak at Milan, in an empty station.

In a cheap bar, sur­rounded by porters and taxi-drivers and therefore solicited from all sides, while a scruffy individual washed down the stone floor between his far too perfect shoes, he drank black coffee and observed his total lack of any feeling. 'Whether we get a divorce, or what we're going to do about it,' she had said, 'I don't know myself yet. For the moment all I want is for you to leave me in peace.' Another thing his wife had said was: 'You don't have to give me my freedom. What do you mean by that? I can take freedom for myself, if I need it.' It was this remark in particular, it seems, which so infuriated the husband that in the broad daylight of Genoa he talked aloud to himself and walked along without really knowing where he was. It didn't matter anyway. Somewhere among warehouses, railway lines, and tar barrels. Yes, there were even moments when he loudly cursed his wife beyond the Alps, with words that did him all the more good the more vulgar they were. He used expressions (so he says) of such crude, unvar­nished obscenity as he had never before heard from his own lips. When someone unexpectedly addressed him he was completely taken aback. He hadn't the slightest wish to see the sights of Genoa. Never in his life had he felt so defenceless - as though anyone could read his jumbled thoughts. At this moment he was incapable of saying No to a boatman, and let himself in for a trip round the harbour. The sea turned out to be grey lead flecked with iridescent patches of oil. Rolf sat on a seat covered with worn cushions, as tense as Rodin's Thinker and quite unable to take in the running commentary provided by the Italian oarsman sitting behind him, which was included in the price. Hot galley water spurted from the side of a ship. At one point they rowed over a sunken merchantman; its seaweed-covered iron plates rose threateningly up out of the filthy depths. Riveting hammers echoed in the distance. For Rolf, of course, it was all like a film, in colour and even with smells, but a film - visible but unreal. From time to time there was a thin siren-wail, carried away by the wind and split up into echoes, impos­sible to tell where it came from or what it meant, since none of the great steamships actually put out to sea.

And there stood Rolf as though only now grasping for the first time the fact that Sibylle was in another man's arms.

As he stood in front of the empty Renaissance gateway, Rolf was really almost glad not to see the slick young Genoese again. But he had lost pretty well all his ready cash. Worse still, it was a discomfiture, just when he would have liked to cut a dash because of his wife; the blow to his pride was incomparably more serious than the loss of twenty thousand lire, irreparable. He dared not look at the parcel tied with string and supposed to contains gent's suiting cloth, which was his security.

 (separating had never occurred to them, and in all the troubles they had passed through up to now both parties had obviously felt at bottom absolutely sure of one another. A fancy-dress ball flirtation, of which Sibylle made a demonstration, he granted his dear wife with magnanimity. He had other worries just then: the problem was whether to become a public prosecutor or not, a crucial decision, and it occupied his mind a good deal more than the fact that Sibylle was going for walks with her fancy-dress pierrot. Rolf didn't even ask his name. And then he had always been of the opinion that one shouldn't be narrow-minded about marriage; he evidently had a very serious theory as to how much freedom should be introduced into a marriage - a man's theory, Sibylle called it. She couldn't stand this theory, it seems; and yet it was based on the knowledge afforded by various sciences. And naturally this theory presupposed com­plete equality of the sexes. It wasn't simply a clever male excuse, as Sibylle frequently said - not merely a clever excuse. Rolf was really perfectly serious about it: his profession had shown him the misery, the hypocrisy, that springs from a view of marriage which has nothing to do with reality, and what he cared about was the idea of a viable marriage and avoiding the indignity of a life of self-deception.

A fancy-dress ball flirtation, of which Sibylle made a demonstration, he granted his dear wife with magnanimity. He had other worries just then: the problem was whether to become a public prosecutor or not, a crucial decision, and it occupied his mind a good deal more than the fact that Sibylle was going for walks with her fancy-dress pierrot. Rolf didn't even ask his name. And then he had always been of the opinion that one shouldn't be narrow-minded about marriage; he evidently had a very serious theory as to how much freedom should be introduced into a marriage &#x2014; a man's theory, Sibylle called it. She couldn't stand this theory, it seems; and yet it was based on the knowledge afforded by various sciences. And naturally this theory presupposed complete equality of the sexes. It wasn't simply a clever male excuse, as Sibylle frequently said&#x2014;not merely a clever excuse. Rolf was really perfectly serious about it: his profession had shown him the misery, the hypocrisy, that springs from a view of marriage which has nothing to do with reality, and what he cared about was the idea of a viable marriage and avoiding the indignity of a life of self-deception. Rolf had a great deal to say on this subject; Sibylle called these talks his 'lectures', but when asked for her opinion&#x2014;and she was asked very often, because Rolf didn't want to entrench himself in a private doctrine&#x2014;she merely answered with the feminine argument that life couldn't be solved with theories...</p>

Sibylle took refuge in a studied interest, and everything seemed all right to her, whether like this or like that, as though she were never going to live in the projected house at all. At the end of the black coffee (my public prosecutor cannot remember how the subject cropped up) the young architect talked about an Eskimo who offered a white stranger his wife, in order to be hospitable, and was so offended when the stranger did not make use of her that he seized his guest by the throat and banged his head against the wall of the igloo until he was dead.

A drunken man staggered out of a noisy tavern, but he was too truculent, too dangerous to be given it. Of course Rolf could simply have thrown his parcel down in the street - but that would have been capitulating. Later, he circled for some time round a blind beggar with outstretched hand. That wouldn't do either he thought. In the last resort he could pay his hotel bill by post later on - besides, his overcoat was still at the hotel. But of course it wasn't a question of whether he could pay his hotel bill at all. It was a question of how he was to rid himself of this parcel. What real reason was there why he shouldn't throw it away? Rolf tried. Nothing could be easier, he thought, than to lose a parcel; nevertheless, his temples were pulsing when, pushed by his common sense, he put the project into execution.

The first person he met was a young woman shuffling along in her slippers. Forward once more. The next was a whistling policeman, and then the street came to an end. In a small square with a tree they were playing football. Rolf was only in the way and through standing in the goalkeeper's line of vision the obvious cause of one side shooting into its own goal, as the result of which a violent quarrel broke out between the youthful teams. Forward once more. He was utterly exhausted again. His train left in forty minutes. But where could he get rid of his gift? A drunken man staggered out of a noisy tavern, but he was too truculent, too dangerous to be given it. Of course Rolf could simply have thrown his parcel down in the street&#x2014;but that would have been capitulating. Later, he circled for some time round a blind beggar with outstretched hand. That wouldn't do either he thought.</p>
<p>In the last resort he could pay his hotel bill by post later on&#x2014;besides, his overcoat was still at the hotel. But of course it wasn't a question of whether he could pay his hotel bill at all. It was a question of how he was to rid himself of this parcel. What real reason was there why he shouldn't throw it away? Rolf tried. Nothing could be easier, he thought, than to lose a parcel; nevertheless, his temples were pulsing when, pushed by his common sense, he put the project into execution. He dropped it in the crowd in front of a red traffic light, squeezed across the street in the general crush and thought he was saved&#x2014;for just then the policeman blew his whistle, the traffic changed and the street behind him was temporarily blocked. To have his hands free at last gave him a feeling of relief, a new <emph type="2">joie de vivre,</emph> as though nothing had happened to Sibylle either.</p>
<p>Rolf lit a cigarette, without looking back to see what had happened to the nightmare parcel, and he didn't need to, for a poorly dressed but attractive young woman pulled at his sleeve and handed back to the absent-minded gentleman the parcel which she had picked up. Rolf dared not deny that it was his, this shabby parcel with its dirty paper and cheap string that scarcely held the pink cloth together any more. Was he <!--leaf189:

 (condemned to carry this pink cloth through the rest of his earthly-life? Ten minutes before the train left, he was still standing help­lessly with the parcel under his arm - five minutes before it left. He put off the capitulation (as he calls it) until the last minute. The carriage doors were already shut when Rolf stepped on to the footboard, and the train was just starting. As though the empty seats were not for him, not for defaulters and deserted husbands, Rolf stoodoutside in thecorridor as far as Milan. What would Sibyllesay to him? Naturally hestill grossly overestimated her need to concern herself with him. After Milan he was not alone in the corridor: a Swiss got into conversation with him, talkative as most people are when they run into a fellow-countryman abroad. Fortunately they soon reached the frontier. After the train left Chiasso he sat in the dining-car, staring out of the window all the time, so that no one passing along the train should recognize him. It never struck him how noticeable he was gazing out of the window all the time, regardless of whether the train was passing through a tunnel or not. With the active imagination that accompanies self-pity, Rolf, more than ever before on a journey, was gazing into the past, and as he looked back he could remember no happiness without Sibylle, not a single significant hour without Sibylle. Everything else was chaff, not worth a thought. Rather suddenly Sibylle had become the whole meaning and content of his life, and now this meaning had passed over to another man, had been transferred to a fancy-dress pierrot, or a Genoese with jet black hair, or a young architect, or whatever it was, had simply been trans­ferred. From Goschenen on, rain splashed diagonally across the window-panes. The best thing, thought Rolf, would be not to let her notice anything: his detachment should annihilate her. Rolf had only to remember her shameless face and the detachment came of its own accord, in response to her face that was not only happy and estranged by happiness, but scornful, insolent, arrogant, triumphant over him, and it would have been the last straw if he, Rolf, with his theories, had started reproaching her: she would have laughed out loud and her contempt would have been plain to see.

What did independence and freedom in marriage really mean - quite practically, what did they mean - ? What was left was common property with all sorts of goods and chattels and a maid to keep them clean. And what about Hannes? It could not go on like this. Should Rolf simply tell his wife to drop it, using threats, an either-or, and give her till Christmas to think it over? It was a possible way of bringing this impossible situa­tion to an end, but not a possible way of preserving or regaining her love. Should he simply wait? A provisional, haphazard life, perhaps she'll come, perhaps she won't, perhaps he'd get used to it, perhaps he'd fall in love himself, and since everything passes, who knows, perhaps a divorce would be premature - a life of blind patience - was that the solution? He stumbled from decision to decision, first one way, then another. How often had Rolf given advice, and where other people were concerned, with all due precaution, it was always much clearer in which direction effort should be exerted. In short, Rolf found himself at that dead point where with the greatest effort one can tear oneself apart, but not turn the wheel either forwards or backwards, and yet whether the wheel turns forwards or backwards depends on a trifle, perhaps on chance; and that was the bitterest thing of all, the thought that every­thing might be decided as though of its own accord by a single word, a good or a foolish word ... During that week he not only received Sturzenegger's prom­ised card from Redwood City, California, but also a very queer telephone call from Paris. A manifestly agitated gentleman, who introduced himself as Stiller, talked some muddled non­sense and seemed to think Rolf was bound to know where his wife was, a man who absolutely refused to believe that Rolf was not well acquainted with his name. The excitable individual whose voice came to him over the telephone was undoubtedly none other than the fancy-dress pierrot. (So what my public prosecutor stated earlier on is not quite true: he did know the name of Sibylle's friend, even if not through Sibylle herself, be­fore Stiller's disappearance.

He simultaneously hoped and no longer hoped. What did independence and freedom in marriage really mean&#x2014;quite practically, what did they mean&#x2014;? What was left was common property with all sorts of goods and chattels and a maid to keep them clean. And what about Hannes? It could not go on like this. Should Rolf simply tell his wife to drop it, using threats, an either-or, and give her till Christmas to think it over? It was a possible way of bringing this impossible situation to an end, but not a possible way of preserving or regaining her love. Should he simply wait? A provisional, haphazard life, perhaps she'll come, perhaps she won't, perhaps he'd get used to it, perhaps he'd fall in love himself, and since everything passes, who knows, perhaps a divorce would be premature&#x2014;a life of blind patience&#x2014;was that the solution?</p>
<p>He stumbled from decision to decision, first one way, then another. How often had Rolf given advice, and where other people were concerned, with all due precaution, it was always much clearer in which direction effort should be exerted. In short, Rolf found himself at that dead point where with the greatest effort one can tear oneself apart, but not turn the wheel either forwards or backwards, and yet whether the wheel turns forwards or backwards depends on a trifle, perhaps on chance; and that was the bitterest thing of all, the thought that everything might be decided as though of its own accord by a single word, a good or a foolish word...</p>
<p>During that week he not only received Sturzenegger's promised card from Redwood City, California, but also a very queer telephone call from Paris. A manifestly agitated gentleman, who introduced himself as Stiller, talked some muddled nonsense and seemed to think Rolf was bound to know where his wife was, a man who absolutely refused to believe that Rolf was not well acquainted with his name. The excitable individual whose voice came to him over the telephone was undoubtedly none other than the fancy-dress pierrot. (So what my public prosecutor stated earlier on is not quite true: he did know the name of Sibylle's friend, even if not through Sibylle herself, before Stiller's disappearance. I only mention this as an example of the fact that even a public prosecutor, in an entirely voluntary <!--leaf202:

 (statement, does not manage altogether to avoid contradicting himself, as they expect us to do during an interrogation.) A very queer telephone call indeed; for Rolf had assumed that Sibylle had gone off with her fancy-dress pierrot. Had the two of them missed each other in Paris? He rejected the thought that this call was an exceedingly cunning attempt to put him on a false scent; but once in his mind the thought would not let go of him. He couldn't credit Sibylle with such a plan. No! he said out loud, No! And from the very back of his mind came the echo, Why not? He tried to throw off this suspicion, felt ashamed of himself, and with the same breath as he felt ashamed of his mean suspicion he thought himself ridiculous for feeling ashamed, a fool. Wasn't anything possible now? His reason revolted at the idea. Was it possible that he would one day hate Sibylle, the mother of his son and moreover closer to him than anyone else he could imagine? He was afraid of meeting her again. It seems that this meeting, when it did take place, was an unfortunate affair. One morning in his office - it was November - he was told his wife wanted to speak to him, no, not on the telephone: she was sitting in the ante-chamber. Now he really was in conference, and she had to wait nearly an hour. It was eleven o'clock; couldn't they simply have lunched together? Rolf gave word for her to come in and went to meet her at the door with the mute question, What's wrong? Sibylle was rather pale, but cheerful. 'Ah,' she said, 'so this is your office?' and went straight over to the window to look at the modest view. Rolf didn't ask, How was it at St Gallen? nor, How was it in Paris? It was for Sibylle to do the talking, he felt, not for him. She acted as though nothing had happened and was more on edge than he had ever known her, chatting as though she had only come to see his new place of work and smoking hurriedly. Rolf might have rung St Gallen; he wisely hadn't done so. Was this what she wanted to find out? Sibylle thanked him for seeing to the move. What else? She had a secret in her eyes, fear too, though she didn't speak of it and didn't want to speak of it.

So this is Sturzenegger, a friend of Stiller's, once a young architect full of enthusiasm for consistent modernism, now a man with a career, a man who is cheerfully resigned, a man with both feet on the ground, and since he is a success he is full of hearty comradeship. 'How about you?' he says at once, without mentioning his success, his hand still on my shoulder. 'What have you done, old fellow, to have been put in this State-subsidized apartment?' As expected, he takes everything very cheerfully, including my request not to mistake me for the missing Stiller. 'Seriously,' he says, 'if there's any way I can help you - ' Once again I feel something uncanny, a mechanism at work in human relations which, whether they are called acquaint­anceship or even friendship, immediately takes all the life out of them, all the immediacy. What could a prisoner like myself do with a banknote?

'You can believe me,' he says, 'otherwise I wouldn't be sitting here on your plank bed in the middle of my working day.' For a whole hour we play Sturzenegger and Stiller and the uncanny thing is, it goes splendidly, without a hitch.

At times it's spooky; Sturze­negger shakes with laughter, I don't know why. He knows the joke his vanished friend would now unfailingly make and I don't need to make this joke, or even to know it.

 (suffering in any way over a spiritual compromise. They make things easier for themselves by simply outlawing the need for greatness. But isn't it the case that the habitual and hence cheap renunciation of the great (the whole, the perfect, the radical) finally leads to impotence even of the imagination? The lack of enthusiasm, the general inability to feel pleasure, that we meet in this country are obvious symptoms of how close we already are to this impotence... 'Let's stick to architecture!' comments Sturzenegger. There follows a discussion concerning the area they call the Old City. I consider it a noble idea to preserve the city of their forefathers and care for it as a memory. And then alongside it, at an appropriate distance, build the city of our own day! In actual fact, however, so far as I can see they are doing neither the one nor the other, but reconstructing their way around any decision. Architects full of talent and love of country are build­ing, as I recently saw, office blocks on about the same scale as the sixteenth or seventeenth or eighteenth century. A tricky business! To be sure, it's possible to camouflage reinforced con­crete (as though it were shameful) with blocks of sandstone, with segmental arches and genuine medieval orioles; but it seems that piety and profit can never be quite reconciled, and the result is something that not even a Negro soldier on leave is going to mistake for Old Europe. Do they themselves take it to be that?

But isn't it the case that the habitual and hence cheap renunciation of the great (the whole, the perfect, the radical) finally leads to impotence even of the imagination? The lack of enthusiasm, the general inability to feel pleasure, that we meet in this country are obvious symptoms of how close we already are to this impotence...</p>
<p>'Let's stick to architecture!' comments Sturzenegger.</p>
<p>There follows a discussion concerning the area they call the Old City. I consider it a noble idea to preserve the city of their forefathers and care for it as a memory. And then alongside it, at an appropriate distance, build the city of our own day! In actual fact, however, so far as I can see they are doing neither the one nor the other, but reconstructing their way around any decision. Architects full of talent and love of country are building, as I recently saw, office blocks on about the same scale as the sixteenth or seventeenth or eighteenth century. A tricky business! To be sure, it's possible to camouflage reinforced concrete (as though it were shameful) with blocks of sandstone, with segmental arches and genuine medieval orioles; but it seems that piety and profit can never be quite reconciled, and the result is something that not even a Negro soldier on leave is going to mistake for Old Europe. Do they themselves take it to be that? It would seem to them crazy, criminal, simply to tear down the city of their forefathers with its narrow alleys in order to make room for their modern city; there would be a paper storm of indignation. In reality they do something much crazier: they mess up the city of their forefathers without building a new, modern one of their own. How is it that such an idiocy, which a foreigner sees at once, doesn't shock the natives? Sturzenegger can't do anything about the ruination of their Old City, on the other hand he shows me photographs of a new town at Oerlikon, a suburb of Z&#xFC;rich, known all over the world for its arms export industry; a town on the scale of a past that is gone, gone forever, an idyll that is no idyll.

 (avoid saying it makes me want to throw up, I ask in a matter-of-fact tone whether Switzerland has such an inexhaustible supply of land that it can afford to go on building in this 'style' for a few more decades. This seems not to be the case. What is tradition? I thought it meant tackling the problems of one's own day with the same courage one's forefathers brought to bear on theirs. Everything else is imitation, mummification, and if they still see their homeland as something alive why don't they defend themselves when mummification claims to be preserva­tion? ... Sturzenegger laughs: 'You're telling me! I've been protesting for years - not pub­licly, of course - and by the way, our Old City is by no means the only piece of idiocy, you know - ' He describes a few others to me, which as a prisoner I can't check. His strikingly enthusiastic agreement (unfortunately it's a while before I notice this) is not based on an identity of outlook, however, but on resentment; Sturzenegger is ridiculing the chief architect of their little town - to whom, on the other hand, as he admits, he owes some not inconsiderable commis­sions - and it is only human that in speaking to a foreigner, who doesn't know their chief architect, he expresses himself with a positively audacious frankness that does him good. For my part, on the other hand, it is only human that I have no interest in this personality or that, but only in the general frame of mind of the country whose prisoner I am. I should like to know the nature of those who are going to sit in judgement on me; that's a very natural wish. So when we talk about architecture the only thing that interests me is the extent to which a Swiss citizen can be bold, can focus on the future, in a country which really, it seems to me, doesn't want the future but the past. Has Switz­erland (I ask Sturzenegger) any goal in the future? To preserve what one has or used to have is a necessary task, but not enough; in order to be alive you need a goal in the future. What is this goal, this unattained objective that inspires them, this aspect of the future that keeps them alive in the present? They are united in the desire to keep the Russians out; but beyond this: what is their goal in the event that they are spared the Russians? What do they want to make of their country? What is to rise up out of the past? What is their plan? Do they have a creative hope? )

 (SIXTH NOTEBOOK THE missing Stiller's studio - as described by Frau Sibylle, the wife of my public prosecutor - must have been a big, light room, a garret somewhere in the Old Town, a room that looked even larger than it was through the lack of furniture, even of useful furniture on which Sibylle could have put her hat and handbag.

<p align="left">T<emph type="6">HE</emph> missing Stiller's studio&#x2014;as described by Frau Sibylle, the wife of my public prosecutor&#x2014;must have been a big, light room, a garret somewhere in the Old Town, a room that looked even larger than it was through the lack of furniture, even of useful furniture on which Sibylle could have put her hat and handbag. Her estimate of thirty by forty-five feet is probably an exaggeration, but how clearly Sibylle remembers this studio in other respects. You walked on old, creaking pinewood planks with holes where the knots had been trodden out; and under a sloping roof, against which she had more than once bumped her head, there must have been something like a kitchen, containing a sink of red terrazzo, a gas cooker, and a cupboard filled with all sorts of odd crockery.

She hadn't been paying attention, at least not to the bullfight, but only to his face; Stiller had to begin the whole description again. 'Watch out!' said Stiller,' - I'm the bull.'

'Thank you,' she said, showing her silver Dunhill lighter, 'I've already got a light.'

The spirit appears in the guise of a silvery white matador, his naked sword under a red cloth, not to kill, oh no, but to conquer, to perform the figures of deadly peril, one after the other, without retreating a step, elegance is all, cowardice is worse than death, the aim is a victory of the spirit over animal life, and only when he has withstood these dangers, withstood them according to all the rules of the art, only then may he use his sword. Silence fills the arena, with all the rage of exhaustion the bull perceives the red cloth again and charges; the silvery white matador stands firm and the sword plunges, the audience go wild with acclamation and the bull stands with outspread legs, waiting, and suddenly he collapses to the front or falls sideways and dies, His eyes roll, his legs stretch out, the rest is an inert lump, a black mass.

Then at last Sibylle used her Dunhill lighter, and the conversation was open again -There was no love-making. 'Your wife is a dancer?' asked Sibylle at one point, but she learned little about this woman whom Stiller had turned into a vase; in fact, to judge by his attitude, she was really only a beautiful, rare, dead vase, to which Stiller was married, an object that was only present when Stiller thought of it; and at the moment Stiller had no real wish to think of it. On the other hand, were Sibylle's comments on her Rolf any more informa­tive?

 ('Did Sturzenegger ever show you our plans?' she asked, and this question led all of a sudden to a sensible conversation, for Stiller turned out to be an ardent champion of modern archi­tecture, about which he knew something, enough, anyhow, to make Sibylle interested for the first time in her own building, to make her enthusiastic in fact, enthusiastic about her own house. It was (so she says) such a pleasant, matter-of-fact, sensible conversation that Stiller had no difficulty in saying, 'You'll stay to supper, won't you?' Actually, of course, it had never occurred to Sibylle to stay to supper; at most she had reckoned with the possibility of having a meal together somewhere in town. 'Can I help you?' she asked rather awkwardly, as Stiller filled a saucepan with water and, still talking about architecture, set it on the old-fashioned gas stove. 'Do you like rice?' he inquired casually, lighting the gas. Of course, Sibylle had made up her mind to leave around nine o'clock, or ten o'clock at the very latest. 'Rice?' she replied at last. 'That'll be lovely.' Stiller had to get the garnishings for a Spanish rice dish, and after the bullfight a Spanish dish was the only possible choice; he had to hurry, otherwise the shops would be shut in his face. After a quick glance into his purse, which was obviously not always full, Stiller went out and left his visitor alone in the studio ... During this half-hour, Sibylle felt rather strange. What did she want? And what didn't she want? Now she had time to think it over. She stood at the big window that looked out on the Great Minster, smoking and trying to remember where she had parked her car, Rolf's car, and couldn't remember because there was so much else going through her head. Ridiculous! Supper in a studio - what did that amount to? Sibylle was then twenty-eight. She had loved twice in her life, no more and no less, and both times it had been an incursion into a life, into the other person's life.

<p>'Did Sturzenegger ever show you our plans?' she asked, and this question led all of a sudden to a sensible conversation, for Stiller turned out to be an ardent champion of modern architecture, about which he knew something, enough, anyhow, to make Sibylle interested for the first time in her own building, to make her enthusiastic in fact, enthusiastic about her own house. It was (so she says) such a pleasant, matter-of-fact, sensible conversation that Stiller had no difficulty in saying, 'You'll stay to supper, won't you?'</p>
<p>Actually, of course, it had never occurred to Sibylle to stay to supper; at most she had reckoned with the possibility of having a meal together somewhere in town. 'Can I help you?' she asked rather awkwardly, as Stiller filled a saucepan with water and, still talking about architecture, set it on the old-fashioned gas stove. 'Do you like rice?' he inquired casually, lighting the gas. Of course, Sibylle had made up her mind to leave around nine o'clock, or ten o'clock at the very latest. 'Rice?' she replied at last. 'That'll be lovely.' Stiller had to get the garnishings for a Spanish rice dish, and after the bullfight a Spanish dish was the only possible choice; he had to hurry, otherwise the shops would be shut in his face. After a quick glance into his purse, which was obviously not always full, Stiller went out and left his visitor alone in the studio...</p>
<p>During this half-hour, Sibylle felt rather strange. What did she want? And what didn't she want? Now she had time to think it over. She stood at the big window that looked out on the Great Minster, smoking and trying to remember where she had parked her car, Rolf's car, and couldn't remember because there was so much else going through her head. Ridiculous! Supper in a studio&#x2014;what did that amount to? Sibylle was then twenty-eight. She had loved twice in her life, no more and no less, and both times it had been an incursion into a life, into the other person's life. The first man she loved, a teacher to whom she owed her school-leaving certificate, divorced his wife, and the second man married her. She had no talent for mere philandering.

 (Russian gun was faultless, of course, I only had to press the trigger...' There followed the final digression, an impartial and quite superfluous description of the tactical position, which Sibylle couldn't follow anyhow. ' - well, there it is,' he broke off, 'Sturzenegger has told you the rest.' It was now eleven o'clock, Sibylle could hear the hour striking on the cathedral clock, with which she had become quite fami­liar. She didn't understand why this story was such a burden to Stiller; she only felt (so she says) that this hour was to him a confession, a confession which not Sibylle, but Stiller himself, had sought, i don't understand,' said Sibylle at last; but Stiller immediately interrupted her, ' - why I didn't shoot?' That wasn't what Sibylle had meant. He laughed, 'Because I'm a failure. Quite simply, I'm not a man.' - 'Because you didn't fire, that day on the Tajo?' - it was treachery,' said Stiller with impatient emphasis. 'There's nothing to explain. I had a job to do, I'd even volunteered for it, I had orders to guard the ferry, perfectly clear orders. What more do you want? It wasn't I that was in the balance, but thousands of others, a cause. I had to fire. What was I in Spain for? It was treachery,' he concluded. 'They should really have put me up against the wall.' - i don't know about that,' commented Sibylle. 'What did Anya, your Polish girl, have to say?' Stiller didn't answer this question at once, but explained how he had later talked his way out of the difficulty by telling the commissar the lie about the gun not going off. 'What did Anya have to say?' he now smiled, twisting a cigarette until there was almost no tobacco left in the wrap­ping, and shrugging his shoulders, 'Nothing. She looked after me until I was well enough to go home. She despised me.' - i thought you said she loved you?' - it was treachery,' insisted Stiller. 'Love makes no difference to that. It was a failure.' Sibylle let him talk, let him repeat himself first in different words and then in the same words, until he refilled his glass and drank. 'Have you never talked to anyone about it?' she asked. 'Not even to your wife?' Stiller briefly shook his head. 'Why not?' she went on to ask. 'Are you ashamed to talk to her about it?' Stiller evaded the question, 'Probably a woman can't understand what it means. I was a coward.' )

<p>There followed the final digression, an impartial and quite superfluous description of the tactical position, which Sibylle couldn't follow anyhow. '- well, there it is,' he broke off, 'Sturzenegger has told you the rest.'</p>
<p>It was now eleven o'clock, Sibylle could hear the hour striking on the cathedral clock, with which she had become quite familiar. She didn't understand why this story was such a burden to Stiller; she only felt (so she says) that this hour was to him a confession, a confession which not Sibylle, but Stiller himself, had sought. 'I don't understand,' said Sibylle at last; but Stiller immediately interrupted her, '&#x2014;why I didn't shoot?' That wasn't what Sibylle had meant. He laughed, 'Because I'm a failure. Quite simply, I'm not a man.'&#x2014;'Because you didn't fire, that day on the Tajo?'&#x2014;'It was treachery,' said Stiller with impatient emphasis. 'There's nothing to explain. I had a job to do, I'd even volunteered for it, I had orders to guard the ferry, perfectly clear orders. What more do you want? It wasn't I that was in the balance, but thousands of others, a cause. I had to fire. What was I in Spain for? It was treachery,' he concluded. 'They should really have put me up against the wall.'&#x2014;'I don't know about that,' commented Sibylle. 'What did Anya, your Polish girl, have to say?' Stiller didn't answer this question at once, but explained how he had later talked his way out of the difficulty by telling the commissar the lie about the gun not going off. 'What did Anya have to say?' he now smiled, twisting a cigarette until there was almost no tobacco left in the wrapping, and shrugging his shoulders, 'Nothing. She looked after me until I was well enough to go home. She despised me.'&#x2014;'I thought you said she loved you?'&#x2014;'It was treachery,' insisted Stiller. 'Love makes no difference to that. It was a failure.' Sibylle let him talk, let him repeat himself first in different words and then in the same words, until he refilled his glass and drank. 'Have you never talked to anyone about it?' she asked. 'Not even to your wife?' Stiller briefly shook his head. 'Why not?' she went on to ask. 'Are you ashamed to talk to her about it?' Stiller evaded the question, 'Probably a woman can't understand what it means. I was a coward.'</p>

 (The bottle was now empty, a litre bottle of chianti: Stiller didn't give the impression of being drunk, he seemed to be used to drinking. Was his drinking also somehow connected with this Tajo affair? Of course Sibylle couldn't simply take him in her arms; Stiller would have felt himself misunderstood as all men do when their seriousness is countered by a different seriousness, indeed, Stiller seemed already to be aware that Sibylle was permitting herself thoughts of her own, and he reiterated with apodictic melancholy, 'It was a failure.' - 'And you imagined,' smiled Sibylle, 'that you were never going to fail in your life?' She had to make her meaning clearer: 'You're ashamed of being as you are. Who demanded of you that you should be a fighter, a warrior, someone who can shoot? You feel you didn't prove yourself there in Spain. Who's denying it? But perhaps you were trying to prove yourself someone you just aren't - ' Stiller wouldn't swallow this. 'I told you already,' he remarked, 'prob­ably a woman can't understand a thing like that.' And Sibylle thought, perhaps better than you like. But she only laughed, 'You men, why do you always try to be so grand? I don't want to hurt your feelings, but - ' Involuntarily she took hold of his hands, a gesture which Stiller apparently misunderstood - any­how, he looked at her with covert contempt, it seemed to her, not in an unfriendly way, but Stiller didn't take her seriously: he took her for a person in love expecting caresses and nothing else. She was a burden to him, a burden. He stroked her hair, the misunderstood man weighed down by tragedy, and now Sibylle, as though frozen by his tender condescension, couldn't utter a word. Stiller (she says) fancied himself in the role of a man with a wound; he didn't want to get over it. He took refuge behind it. He didn't want to be loved. He was afraid of it. 'Now you know,' he said, clearing the glasses away, 'why I didn't shoot. What's the point of this story? I'm not a man. I've dreamt about it for years: I want to shoot, but the gun doesn't go off - I don't need to tell you what that means, it's a typical impotence dream.' This remark, which he made while standing in the kitchen recess, upset Sibylle and she stood up. She was sorry she had come to his studio. She felt a sadness, which she concealed, and at the same time she was sorry for Stiller. Why didn't he want to be loved, really loved? There was nothing left )

In order to show that his fatigue was not her fatigue, she proposed that she should go to the recommended film alone. Rolf raised no objec­tion. She dropped the idea - not because of a bad conscience, which she did not have even now that she was face to face with him, but rather out of a motherly feeling.

That this was not the case, seems to have been due mainly to Rolf. He flung his beer glass into the sink. 'What's the matter?' she asked. He deduced from her unfriendliness that Sibylle, his dear wife with her old-fashioned ideas, once more suspected him; Rolf had had enough. He found it so petty, so narrow-minded; once more (but with a clear hint that it was for the last time) Rolf delivered his 'lecture' and refused to be interrupted, no, Sibylle must really develop a more generous conception of marriage, she must have confidence, must grasp the fact that Rolf loved her, even if he did occasionally meet another woman )

Not unreasonably, he found it unnecessary for Sibylle to check the monthly bills from the milkman and the butcher at this particular moment, he thought it unfair to a husband who had just arrived from London, and showed his ill-humour, yes, it looked as though the evening would go off in a state of marital ill-humour of an everyday kind, in other words pretty well.</p>
<p>That this was not the case, seems to have been due mainly to Rolf. He flung his beer glass into the sink. 'What's the matter?' she asked. He deduced from her unfriendliness that Sibylle, his dear wife with her old-fashioned ideas, once more suspected him; Rolf had had enough. He found it so petty, so narrow-minded; once more (but with a clear hint that it was for the last time) Rolf delivered his 'lecture' and refused to be interrupted, no, Sibylle must really develop a more generous conception of marriage, she must have confidence, must grasp the fact that Rolf loved her, even if he did occasionally meet another woman <!--leaf241:

He forbade fits of jealousy. But this chance passed too. Sibylle wanted to assure him that she understood him as never before, that she felt no trace of jealousy; it would have been the truth but at the same time downright mockery, and she couldn't utter a word, not a word. Sibylle's only wish was to be alone as quickly as possible. It was horrible, it was becoming farcical. When Sibylle gave him a hearty kiss on the forehead, she felt superior in a way that made her feel ashamed. Involuntarily, she locked her door. Her happiness wasn't a dream. As soon as Sibylle found herself alone, it filled her again in all its reality. Tact alone prevented her from singing. But her silent happiness was apparently audible through the walls, and her husband, although he had said everything that needed saying, could not rest. The locked door took him aback; he insisted on coming into her room, and only when he was sitting on her bed ready to play the Good Samaritan, having obviously expected a tear-stained face and dumbfounded to see a happy one, did the truth begin to dawn on Rolf. He asked, 'What's happened?' Sibylle couldn't find the right words in which to tell him a thing like that; she said, 'You know quite well.' Rolf's choice of words wasn't particularly fortunate either, 'You've been with a man?' Sibylle said Yes and was glad to be rid of her silence, relieved and now completely happy for the first time. Rolf stared at her. She begged him to ask no more questions now and to leave her alone. Rolf (says Sibylle) took it with remarkable composure. He even went away for a few days in order to leave Sibylle in peace, for which she was grateful to him from the bottom of her heart. After his return he was also (says Sibylle) remarkably composed.

'Am I in the way?' asked Sibylle, as Stiller, after greeting her with an almost perfunctory kiss, went on sawing at a stand. She looked at him. A man never looks so handsome, she thought, as when he is working with his hands. 'I don't want to hold you up,' she said, 'but I just had to see you today...'

 (difference and what a lot of stands still needed varnishing, while from others, which were fortunately already varnished, the varnish had to be removed! That was the job at the moment. 'What about your wife,' asked Sibylle, 'are you going to exhibit her?' She had put on a kettle for tea and it was already boiling, so she was also occupied. 'I've brought you something,' said Sibylle. i've been baking.' And she showed him a fresh cake, a so-called seed cake; Stiller was touched, without looking at it, and talked about humbug.

<p>It had imperceptibly grown cool, and Sibylle stood up, walked along the swaying boat to Stiller, took his head between her wet hands, and kissed him over and over again. He let go of the rope, so that the sail flapped, and asked, 'What's the matter?' Sibylle didn't yet know herself.</p>
<break type="graphic"/>
<p align="left">'Men are funny,' Sibylle still thinks so today: 'You with your seriousness! For hours and days, sometimes for weeks, one could imagine you want nothing else than the nearness of a woman you love, you seek this nearness thoughtlessly, you'd shrink from nothing, one supposes, from no danger, from no ridicule, and certainly not from brutality, if anyone stood in your way, there is only the woman, it seems, the woman you love&#x2014;and then, in the twinkling of an eye, it's quite different, suddenly it turns out that a sitting is important, so important that everything has to be fitted in with it. You suddenly become edgy, you find the woman a fond burr that you can't shake off. I know this silly consideration for all sorts of strangers, for everyone but the woman who loves you. You and your serious affairs of life! An international conference of lawyers, the curator of an art gallery&#x2014;suddenly there are once more things that must on no account be neglected. And woe to the woman who doesn't understand that, or even smiles! And then, in a twinkling of an eye, you're like little Hannes during a thunderstorm again. Isn't that true? These same men have to put their heads on our shoulders, so as not to despair, to feel that they are not entirely lost in this serious world, not entirely superfluous with all their legal eminence and art exhibitions ... God knows,' she laughed, 'you're a queer lot!'</p>

<p align="left">One day at the end of September Stiller said over the telephone, 'Get ready, we're going to Paris.' She couldn't believe her receiver. 'Are you serious?' The cheerful voice answered, 'Why not?' Still half in doubt whether Stiller was not joking, already half joyously serious she asked, 'When?' The cheerful voice answered, Tomorrow, today, when you like.' (They knew the trains to Paris by heart; there was a night train that came in <!--leaf250:

'I'm coming over right away,' said Sibylle; but it wasn't as simple as that, for in the morning Stiller was receiving another visit from his curator, and in the afternoon Sibylle had to take little Hannes to the circus. 'After the circus then,' she said and put down the receiver, as dizzy as a person who has just won a prize, empty with happiness...</p>
<p>At last things seemed to be moving.</p>
<p>'What shall we say,' asked Rolf over coffee, 'we must order the removal van, when would it suit you? I've no intention of making the whole move by myself. Will you be here next week?' Sibylle quite understood his urgency, troublesome as she found it. 'Yes, yes,' she said, 'I know, but I can't tell you today.'&#x2014;'When will you be able to tell me?'&#x2014;'Tomorrow.'&#x2014;'Why are you so on edge?'&#x2014;'I'm not on edge,' she retorted. 'Why should I be on edge?' Sibylle had hoped she would be able to let her decision mature; now she suddenly had a twenty-four-hour ultimatum. After all, it concerned everything in the world that mattered to her, Stiller, Rolf, Hannes, it concerned a life that was not yet born, people to whom her heart was bound, it concerned herself, it involved the question whether Sibylle would be capable of choosing her life for herself. All this was in the balance. And Rolf wanted to know by tomorrow, so that he could order the removal van, tomorrow over coffee...</p>
<p>The children's performance at the circus (says Sibylle) was anything but a distraction for her; on the contrary, this was where she reached her decision&#x2014;for Paris, for Stiller, for the risk. By daylight, thought Sibylle, these circuses look much shabbier, downright pathetic; the dilapidation behind the showy fa&#xE7;ade is visible everywhere; this makes the light under the tent with the sun shining on it all the lovelier, a light like amber, and on top of this the stands filled with a motley crowd of children and the buzz of their voices, and then the brass band, the stench of beasts, and every now and then a roar as though from the jungle. Sibylle found it magnificent. In Paris, she thought, there would be some kind of a job she could do, <!--leaf251:

Sibylle was not afraid. The clown who opened the performance evidently took the children for stupid adults, his success was meagre, and little Hannes, at the circus for the first time, stared at the silly man without smiling, only glad when he stumbled, and didn't want him to come back. Sibylle was to tell the clown not to come back. But then came the leaping tigers! The crack of a whip and hoarse growling&#x2014;Sibylle was fascinated, and for a few minutes she even forgot Paris, while Hannes sucked a sweet and asked why the nasty animals had to keep jumping through the hoop. He couldn't see any proper point in it. The seals, on the other hand, enchanted him, and on top of all the decisions she had to make, Sibylle now had to decide whether she wouldn't like to be a seal. While the horses were waltzing Hannes wanted to go home. Now Sibylle could easily have gone to Stiller. She didn't do so. Not yet. And then, as the lives of seven men hung from the smiling teeth of a girl on the trapeze, Hannes spotted down below through the stands a scruffy-looking man in boots, who was dressing up all kinds of dogs in quaint little jackets, black dress suits, and white bridal veils, and the dogs could scarcely wait. After this, Sibylle had to take little Hannes on her knees, so that he shouldn't fall down between the scaffolding. By this time, it seems, she had made up her mind. And yet all her attention was on the daring act on the glittering trapeze. She would manage somehow, she thought. Suddenly the children all round yelled their approval with a single voice: the silvery trapeze lady had just left her celestial swing with a <emph type="2">salto mortale,</emph> bounced up and down in the net, and just look, she hadn't broken her neck, and the orchestra blared out Verdi. Interval. Hannes wanted to go outside like all the other children, but Sibylle sat as though spellbound: A person in fancy dress, who obviously earned her living like this, was selling chocolates, and this was doubtless the biggest attraction of the afternoon for Sibylle: an independent woman&#x2014;</p>
<p>Just before seven o'clock, after bringing Hannes safely home, she came to Stiller, who was whistling in his studio like a reed-sparrow, the trunk with the hinges pulled out and already packed. Of course, he was quite serious about the trip to Paris. Why had Sibylle come without her luggage? Now it turned out <!--leaf252:

What about Julika? He had such a magnificent pretext for going to Paris, and Julika had no excuse to excite herself and send her temperature curve up on account of this trip. Sibylle understood. She said simply:</p>
<p>'No.'</p>
<p>Stiller was offended.</p>
<p>'I'm going&#x2014;'</p>
<p>'Yes,' she said. 'Do.'</p>
<p>He thought her strange. For months they had been talking and dreaming of Paris, and now&#x2014;</p>
<p>'Do that,' said Sibylle. 'Go to Paris.'</p>
<p>Stiller went (he had to, anyway) in the hope that Sibylle would regret her passing mood and follow him. Sibylle was no longer interested in his hopes. The following day over coffee, she said to Rolf, 'I'm not going to Paris.' Rolf made an effort not to lose his remarkable composure in his joy. Then she said, 'But I'm going for a week to my friend at St Gallen.' And now, would you believe it, the cup was shattered against the wall. When Sibylle was alone, she took the telephone book on her knee, crushed her cigarette in the ashtray, looked up the number of the doctor, the only one who could be considered for the purpose, immediately dialled the number and waited without hearing the pulsing of her heart. She was only astonished by her calmness. It bad to be, and the quicker the better.</p>
<break type="graphic"/>
<p align="left">Rolf naturally didn't believe in the girl friend at St Gallen for a moment. He felt tricked and fooled, and as far as he was concerned that was the end. The unfortunate meeting in his office&#x2014;after her discharge from the nursing home&#x2014;looked quite different through his wife's eyes from the way Rolf, my public prosecutor, described it; the stubborn silence was not of her making (Sibylle assured me) but of his.</p>

') -->a handshake, after a moment in the doorway when Sibylle felt she would sink into the floor if his hands did not bear her up, she walked past Rolf (that is true) straight to the window, as though she had come to see the view. 'So this is your office?' she said in a tone as though nothing had happened. 'Magnificent.' It was pure embarrassment. 'Yes,' he replied, 'this is my office.' He looked her up and down as though she had returned from a lovers' trip. 'I want to talk to you,' said Sibylle categorically. Rolf motioned her into the lounge-chair like a client and offered her a cigarette from a large box on the desk, official cigarettes, so to speak. 'Thank you,' said Sibylle and inquired, 'How are you?' And Rolf, without altering the intonation, simply echoed, 'How are you?'</p>
<p>So they sat facing one another and smoking, Rolf behind his big desk, while Sibylle felt as though she were in an open field. Did he want to hear at all how much she felt she owed him? He didn't even ask ironically, What was it like at St Gallen? 'You must forgive me,' said Rolf, 'in half an hour I've got a case.' And of course Sibylle didn't utter a word. Why didn't he ask her straight out where she had been? Or quite simply, Why are you lying? Instead he merely announced: 'The move is finished. Fortunately we had fine weather...' His report of the move was completely matter-of-fact, without a hint of reproach for Sibylle's absence. 'For the moment I've just had your things put in the room,' he explained. 'I don't know how you want to arrange your room, or even whether&#x2014;' Unfortunately they were interrupted by the telephone. (From the nursing home Sibylle had gone first to their old home. The echo of her footsteps in the empty rooms, the faded wallpaper with the darker rectangles due to the now vanished pictures, the dilapidation everywhere, the impossibility of believing that she had lived between these walls for six years, and all this after her easy, secret, necessary loss, which had nevertheless cried out to heaven through all her narcosis, all this was horrible, and Sibylle had wept, as though she saw in this empty and dilapidated, unspeakably shabby home that was no longer a home the graphic symbol of her whole life. She had tried to phone Rolf, but in vain; the telephone had already been disconnected. Then she went to the new house to see the lady's room&#x2014;an utter muddle, <!--leaf254:

Hannes had left her no peace, and when he wanted to show her Daddy's new room Sibylle had stopped still in the doorway. Then she had come here...)</p>
<p>At last the telephone was dealt with, Rolf replaced the receiver and seemed to be recalling the interrupted conversation. But then he said: 'Someone rang up from Paris, a certain Herr Stiller, your lover I suppose&#x2014;' Sibylle only looked at him. 'I imagine,' he added, 'that you met the gentleman in Paris after all...' This last straw wasn't even necessary, Sibylle had already picked up her handbag and involuntarily risen to her feet. 'Where are you going?' was all he asked. 'To the mountains,' answered Sibylle shortly, thinking with presence of mind of a poster she had seen on the way, 'to Pontresina.' And Rolf, that dunderhead for whom it wasn't yet enough of a farce, actually accompanied her to the door. 'Do as you please,' he said, picking up the glove she had dropped. 'Thank you,' said Sibylle and she could really have gone now, indeed, she didn't know herself why she went over to the window again instead of out through the door.</p>
<p>'I think it's ridiculous,' she remarked, 'completely ridiculous, the way we are behaving, childish...' Rolf said nothing. 'You're wrong,' she said and had to go on speaking somehow,'&#x2014;you've no right to treat me like this. Did you think I would come and ask your forgiveness? We were never a marriage, Rolf, not even before. Never. That's the point. At bottom it was never anything for you but an affair, no more, you never believed in marriage&#x2014;' Rolf smiled. Sibylle was surprised herself at her speech, at her accusing tone. It was not at all what she had really intended to say. 'Rolf!' she said, sitting down on the edge of a chair without putting down her handbag, ready to go the moment she felt she was in the way. 'I didn't come to reproach you. Only&#x2014;' Rolf waited. 'I don't know,' she said to herself, 'what's to happen now.'</p>
<p>Rolf stood and said nothing. Why doesn't he help me out, she thought, forgetting that there was a great deal which he simply couldn't know, that he had no idea where Sibylle had <!--leaf255:

'I never thought,' went on Sibylle, 'that we should come to this. I imagined something different by marriage. You and your lectures! I thought you were speaking from experience...' She looked at him. I don't know,' he said, 'what you want.' Sibylle really had to collect her thoughts. 'I'm not complaining, Rolf, I've no right to. It just happened like that. You're free, I'm free, and yet everything is so wretched ... What do I want?' She asked back, 'Don't you know?' A rather mocking smile, may be, even a contemptuous smile came on to her face, the sort of expression with which one does look at a person who is shamming. For so much blindness, it seemed to her, could only be a sham. What was the point of this comedy?</p>
<p>Then suddenly Sibylle wanted to throw herself on to his breast, but remained standing a few paces away from her husband, as though she could not get through the look in his eyes. 'Do you hate me?' she asked with a faint, involuntary laugh. When a person with whom we are intimate hates us for the first time it seems almost like bluff, but it was his real face, there was no getting away from it, and her laughter froze. He hated her. He looked quite different, too. Sibylle no longer recognized him; he was only outwardly like himself.</p>
<p>'...Lover!' she went on somewhere in her own thoughts. 'I wasn't looking for a lover, you know that very well.'&#x2014;'What then?'&#x2014;'I don't need "a man", any man. That's your theory. You weren't just "a man" for me. Why did you marry at all? For you it's just "a woman", an affair with "a woman", any woman. That's why I say you're a bachelor, a married bachelor. Go on, smile! Either marriage is a destiny, I believe, or there is no sense in it at all, it's a piece ofhumbug. I've behaved stupidly, I know. It hurt me when you fell in love somewhere, that's true, and perhaps I was petty. Latitude in marriage&#x2014;what does that mean. I don't want latitude, I want to be more than just "a woman" to my husband. Why can't you understand that? My father isn't just "a man" to me. And Hannes isn't just "a child", whom we happen to love because we feel like it ... Oh Rolf,' she interrupted herself, 'that's all nonsense!'&#x2014;'You mean,' concluded Rolf, 'that we've never been married?'&#x2014;'Yes.'&#x2014;'And that consequently there's no reason why you should tell <!--leaf256:

'I don't understand why you came to me at all.'&#x2014;'When you talk like that, I don't understand either,' said Sibylle. 'I came to have a real talk with you. You've got no time now, I know. You never have time when it doesn't suit you. And then I really come at the stupidest moments.'</p>
<p>Rolf smoked. 'What did you really want to talk to me about?'&#x2014;'I'm naive, you're right. I'm still naive. Only I don't care about your superior smile any more,' she said. 'Somehow I find you simply stupid.' She specified: 'It's only that you can express yourself better than I can, that's why I always let you talk. Did you think I regarded you as the only man in the whole world I could love? I realized that you felt so certain of me, Rolf, but in a quite different sense ... Do you remember my British officer in Cairo?' she interpolated. 'You never took him seriously, I know. He had a lot of things you haven't got, Rolf, things that I miss. And yet it would never have occurred to me, in fact the idea would have seemed absurd, that I should travel on with another man instead of you. I wonder why? I don't know where I got my ideas about marriage from, but I still have them&#x2014;even now ... Perhaps it would be best,' she concluded after a moment's thought, 'if we got a divorce.' As she said this she gazed out of the window and did not see his expression; anyhow, he said nothing. 'Think it over,' she said. 'I never imagined it would be possible for us to divorce. I approved of all the divorces among our acquaintances. I always thought that in these cases it had never been a marriage at all. They were just affairs, legalized to satisfy bourgeois taste, but invalid from the outset. Why should they stay together? That would have seemed to me like putting up a scarecrow and then being afraid to go into your own garden. They just weren't marriages, but only "bourgeois" affairs. You always called me "bourgeois" when my feelings didn't suit you, but now I think you are much more "bourgeois" than I am, seriously. Why else did you legalize our affair, if you didn't believe in marriage? Just because we were expecting a child...'</p>
<p>Rolf let her talk. 'I know,' smiled Sibylle, 'you like to be composed. Whether I want to go to Paris or to Pontresina, you're always composed. And you think it's your magnanimity. <!--leaf257: 
type:ital
 ( watching) page:256 (257) re:oddchar_endp (-&lt;/p&gt;) -->Isn't that so? Your magnanimity is supposed to coerce me. Fundamentally, I often think, you only want my obedience. So as to have your freedom! That's all. You're waiting for my "lover" to leave me, as you leave your women, and then there'll be no one but you; that's all your love, all your composure, all your magnanimity amounts to ... Oh, Rolf,' she repeated, 'that's all nonsense.'&#x2014;'And where do you see sense?' asked Rolf, but the telephone rang again and he had to go over to the desk. 'I don't know,' said Sibylle, 'why I tell you all this&#x2014;'</p>
<p>Rolf picked up the receiver: it was the secretary, ringing through to remind him, as instructed, about the sitting, a so-called summing-up for the jury. 'I won't keep you any longer,' said Sibylle, watching him fill his brief-case with papers. 'Are you angry with me?' she asked. 'Why don't you answer?' Rolf hunted for his ballpoint pen on the desk, then in his pocket, then on the desk again. 'I see,' he said, 'you're disappointed that I didn't forbid you anything&#x2014;' His smile showed that he was making an effort to find the whole thing humorous. 'No,' said Sibylle, 'you're really not in a position to forbid me anything, Rolf, that's the miserable thing about it, from the beginning you merely had an affair with me, to be exact, and therefore no right to prevent me from having another affair&#x2014;' Meanwhile Rolf had found his ballpoint, and there was no further reason why they shouldn't say good-bye. Rolfs hand was on the door-handle; if it had really been her Rolf, she would have thrown her arms round his neck and wept. It wasn't Rolf, it was a mask that seemed to her ridiculous. 'You must do what you think right,' he said once more, opening the door, ushering her through the antechamber and politely accompanying her to the lift&#x2014;</p>
<p>So now she had to go to Pontresina.</p>
<p>Pontresina greeted her with a shower of rain and a feeling of shock, as though she had not imagined for an instant that she would really arrive at Pontresina. Pontresina consisted in the fact that the train simply went no further; worse still&#x2014;at this time of day there was no train back. Sibylle felt trapped. Apart from herself, only two local people had got out. She abandoned herself to some porter in a green apron, who had loaded her trunk and her skis on to a sledge; Sibylle followed through the <!--leaf258:

The crazy poster&#x2014;it might as well have been a poster of Capri or a North Sea spa&#x2014;had naturally referred to February or March, not November. True, the porter asserted that there was good snow higher up. What was Sibylle to do in the snow? What was she to do in this old-fashioned first-class hotel? For half an hour, without taking off her fur coat, which now represented, as it were, her last habitation, she sat on the bed listening to a loud-speaker blaring Danubian waltzes over an empty skating rink lit by spotlights. Later she went down into the bar, ordered a whisky, and sought refuge in a flirtation with a gentleman who happened to be French and therefore witty...</p>
<break type="graphic"/>
<p align="left">A confrontation with Wilfried Stiller, Dip. Agric., has been fixed for Friday week: 'possibly accompanied by a joint visit to his mother's grave', as I learn from my copy of the instructions.</p>
<break type="graphic"/>
<p align="left">The end seems to have been very unpleasant, and her leave-taking from Stiller&#x2014;however clearly we can see that something is at an end, the leave-taking still has to be performed&#x2014;unfortunately (says Sibylle) was not accomplished without profound mortification, not without humiliating even herself.</p>
<p>I record the facts:</p>
<p>Sibylle, at that time passionately keen on sports, romped in Pontresina and was only glad that Stiller, now back from Paris, hadn't the money to come after her. Instead he pestered her with so many phone calls that the concierge in her hotel, who soon realized how unwanted these calls were, wore a grimace of sympathy every time he came to announce 'Z&#xFC;rich'. The only half-conscious hope that it might be Rolf prevented her from simply pretending not to be there. Also the concierge went a little too far for her liking with his shameless discretion: 'I'm afraid not,' she heard him say, 'Frau Doktor has just gone out, yes, this very minute,' as she stood in the hall, watching the expression of this noble ponce, who was undoubtedly banking on an extra tip for special services. She went straight into the booth and rang Stiller. But Stiller, it seems, had taken leave of <!--leaf259:

He was furious, because he had had to beg her address from Carola, the Italian maid, and now he mounted his high horse. What was Sibylle to say to him? There was snow, yes, pretty good snow, no, today the sun was shining as well, oh yes, there was a very nice crowd at the hotel, and then she chatted about the terrific progress she had made in the ski-ing school, about <emph type="2">R&#xFC;cklage</emph> and <emph type="2">Vorlage</emph>, about swinging from the hips and so on. Sibylle prattled like a bobbysoxer: about a 'heavenly' dancer, yes, yes, the Frenchman, about the 'crazy' atmosphere, her room was 'sweet', the skating rink was 'gorgeous', oh no, the Frenchman wasn't the only one who wanted to marry her, as a matter of fact they all did, a 'jolly bunch' really, and the ski-ing instructor, a Grison, was an 'absolute darling'. From time to time, while Stiller said nothing, the voice came through with, Three minutes are up, will you please insert the sum indicated. Three minutes are up, will you please&#x2014;' and Sibylle inserted the money, as though the conversation was not yet childish enough. The devil had got into her, and this was a thoroughly agreeable feeling, she found, at any rate a feeling that suppressed many other feelings, and there was nothing of which Sibylle was so afraid as of her real feelings...</p>
<p>Rolf, her husband, remained mute.</p>
<p>When Stiller turned up at the hotel one day to find out what was really going on, he obviously hadn't strength enough to set this utterly confused woman free from her childish tone; Stiller let himself be hurt by this false tone, and this made the helpless Sibylle pitilessly superior. It was as though a mechanism was at work: no sooner did she feel that this man felt sorry for himself than she couldn't help hurting him. They walked across the plateau towards Samaden. Sibylle in black ski-ing trousers, elegant, athletic, suntanned, while Stiller wore his everlasting U.S. Army greatcoat and was as pale-faced as everyone from the lowlands. 'How's your exhibition going?' she inquired. 'Has your bronze been cast yet?' Her buoyant tone rendered him dumb and dull-witted. He could think of simply nothing to say. Then there was her gentleman from D&#xFC;sseldorf, a wonderful fellow always shooting a line about his experiences as a fighter pilot on the Eastern Front and in Crete, a good deal more amusing than Stiller! She told him straight out. 'And I can tell <!--leaf260:

And Stiller had to listen while she told him how impressed she was by all the money he 'made', this son of a family in heavy industry who yet took life so lightly. 'But as a man he's not my type,' said Sibylle, and Stiller looked at her out of the corner of his eye, then he relapsed into his mute melancholy. The most he said was once: 'Pontresina makes me sick!' Sibylle had a twisted ankle and limped slightly. 'But yesterday I went dancing again,' she said.</p>
<p>Something was egging her on to delight in everything Stiller despised and to tell him all over again how witty this gentleman from D&#xFC;sseldorf was, a knight of the Iron Cross, how manly and entertaining and full of ideas; if he felt he had hurt somebody's feelings, for example, whether it was a man or a woman, he made them a present of a Mercedes. 'Cross my heart!' Stiller only said, 'I quite believe you.' Or another example: There was a young girl in her hotel who had fallen in love with a Swedish student, and immediately this gentleman from D&#xFC;sseldorf had the charming idea of bringing the Swedish student over&#x2014;by aeroplane. 'Simply enchanting,' commented Sibylle, to show her tedious mope that men who make money are not on that account necessarily devoid of charm. Perhaps Stiller said once, 'Possibly.' Or he asked, 'Why do you tell me that?' But he was hurt; he had no means of stopping Sibylle. Moreover, on that walk Sibylle noticed for the first time that Stiller stammered, that there were certain words he couldn't say, words beginning with M.</p>
<p>Once a young fellow passed them, a coffee-brown face with the white poster smile of a Grison ski instructor; Sibylle greeted him with a Hallo, then she said, 'That was Nuot.' He asked with tired obedience, 'Who is Nuot?' So that was the ski-ing instructor who had actually carried her all the way to the nearest rescue sledge when she twisted her ankle. 'Isn't he a darling?' she asked. The conversation continued in this tone.</p>
<p>Of course Sibylle knew perfectly well what sort of inn he would have liked, some country pub used by the locals. But once the devil had got into her&#x2014;and she was enjoying this feeling, as I have said&#x2014;she immediately thought of a 'ripping' place. Why didn't Stiller resist? His lack of confidence was an <!--leaf261:

Was this the man she had loved? The 'ripping' restaurant proved to be an orgy of'ye olde' Switzerland such as Stiller couldn't stand at any price, but they had already been relieved of their wardrobe by at least six hands and the Frau Doktor had been greeted as a regular customer. And all the rest of it&#x2014;the way they were shown to a particular little table and handed two extensive menus printed in the style of the Gutenberg Bible, the head waiter in tails who was so kind as to recommend fresh lobster, a recommendation which he made in the most personal manner&#x2014;all this was compounded of precisely the mixture of <emph type="2">noblesse</emph> and blackmail that rendered the lower-middle-class Stiller, when he was not at his best, completely defenceless. On the table stood three roses, all included in the price, and everything, naturally, by candlelight. Stiller didn't even dare to tell Sibylle that he thought the prices grotesque. 'What will you have?' asked Sibylle in a motherly way, adding, 'I've got money on me.' A wine waiter was already standing there, dressed up as a cooper, and Sibylle was in favour of 'her' Chateauneuf-du-Pape at sixteen francs the bottle, but ready chilled. 'You'll see,' she told Stiller, 'the Chateauneufhere is a poem!' Sibylle listened to herself; the devil gave her the vocabulary of a person whom Stiller couldn't answer. And then, after she had ordered 'her' <emph type="2">filet mignon</emph> with little more than a nod, she compelled the helpless Stiller to eat snails, though Stiller was a trifle doubtful whether snails and Chateauneuf-du-Pape went together; Stiller had never eaten snails, as he was forced to admit; this made him feel inferior and therefore not entitled to a contradictory opinion. All right then, snails!</p>
<p>And then a gentleman nodded to Sibylle and told her very briefly, so as not to interrupt, in French that he had passed his second-class test today; Sibylle congratulated him with a wave of the hand and informed Stiller that he had just been looking at 'Charles Boyer'. Stiller who was nibbling with shy hunger at a roll, asked, 'Who is Charles Boyer?' The heavenly dancer, the Frenchman, and while Stiller had to taste the Chateauneuf-du-Pape, she told him the 'sweet' story of how she had humorously addressed this Frenchman&#x2014;who, incidentally, was in the diplomatic service&#x2014;while they were dancing, as Charles Boyer&#x2014;and his name actually was Boyer.

Stiller looked at her like a dog that doesn't understand human speech, and Sibylle had half a mind to stroke him like a dog. She refrained from doing so in order not to arouse vain hopes. When she saw that Stiller had already drunk from his glass, she said gaily, <emph type="2">'Prosit!'</emph> at which Stiller, filled with embarrassment, raised his almost empty glass,'<emph type="2">Prosit&#x2014;'</emph></p>
<p>And all the time, Sibylle felt so rotten that she could eat hardly any of the<emph type="2">filet mignon;</emph> Stiller, on the other hand, whether it turned his stomach or not, had to get down his twelve snails. Meanwhile Sibylle&#x2014;who had to make all the conversation, so dull was he&#x2014;lit a cigarette and gave him an additional piece of news: 'Sturzenegger has written to me. He needs a secretary, what do you think of that, and me of all people.' Stiller poked about in his snail shells. 'He's in love with me,' added Sibylle. 'Even my husband noticed that. Seriously. And I like your friend...' In between she gave instructions; 'You must eat the juice, old chap, that's the best part of it.' Stiller obeyed and ate the juice. 'Seriously,' continued Sibylle, 'Sturzenegger has invited me. Apparently he loves it over there in California. A hundred dollars a week, what do you think of that, and my passage paid. A hundred dollars is a lot, I think, and in a quarter of an hour you're by the sea&#x2014;'</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Not until they were on the way back to the hotel did they have a rather more real, though short and one-sided conversation. They walked through crunching snow, a cloud in front of their mouths; it was bitterly cold, but beautiful, to left and right walls of snow, the houses as though covered in white featherbeds, stars up above, a night of porcelain. 'Where are you staying?' inquired Sibylle when they stood in front of the ornate entrance to her hotel. 'Will you be here tomorrow?' she went on, trying to introduce the farewell, if possible the final farewell. '&#x2014;it was simply too much of a shock for me,' she remarked, breaking into his silence. 'All of a sudden it suited you, now that you had to go to Paris anyway, now you had a good excuse, now you wanted me to come, now our Paris was suddenly possible. At that moment I felt like your mistress...' Stiller said nothing, and whether he understood what had snapped in her remained uncertain. What was he brooding <!--leaf263:

And since she had no other declaration to make, Sibylle inquired the name of a constellation above the snow-covered entrance&#x2014;she had to ask twice before Stiller told her.</p>
<p>'Yes,' she said then, as though it had some connexion with this constellation, 'where shall I be in a year? I've no idea. Perhaps really over in California!...It's funny,' she added, 'with you one knows perfectly well. I don't believe you will ever change, not even in your outward life.' She hadn't meant to be unkind, but felt the harshness of her words and tried to soften them: 'Or do you think you will ever become a different person?' This sounded no gentler, on the contrary. All speech was simply out of place now. 'Oh Stiller,' she said at length, I was really very fond of you&#x2014;' A long-distance skier on a training run, somebody like Nuot, swept past the mute couple with vigorous movements of his softly pattering skis. They gazed after him, as though sport interested them above all else; unfortunately he soon vanished from sight and left them alone with each other again. And then no doubt the indecision simply became unbearable; they parted&#x2014;not yet capable of saying farewell&#x2014;after quickly agreeing to meet at breakfast next morning.</p>
<p>At breakfast Stiller did not appear.</p>
<p>Two days later, when Sibylle came out of the dining room accompanied by the gentleman from D&#xFC;sseldorf, there he stood, without approaching Sibylle, like a ghost. 'Why didn't you come before?' she asked at once, not waiting to greet him first; Sibylle was taken aback. 'Have you already eaten?' he asked. 'Haven't you?' she asked back. Stiller was pale with fatigue and unshaven. 'Where have you come from?' she asked, and Stiller helped her into the fur coat which a bell-hop, a Grison boy in a circus livery, had carried after her. 'I expected you for breakfast the day before yesterday,' said Sibylle and repeated her question, 'Where have you come from?' She nodded to the gentleman from D&#xFC;sseldorf, who had waited by the lift, busy lighting a cigar, a cavalier skilled in self-effacement, so that Stiller hadn't even noticed him, the wonderful fellow...</p>
<p>Stiller had come from Davos. She learnt this just as they were passing through the revolving door out into the cold. 'From Davos?' she asked, but the glass panel had already interposed <!--leaf264: 
type:ital
 ( Brissago) 
type:ital
 ( ofRbsti) page:263 (264) -->itself between her and Stiller, who was following behind. 'From Davos?' she repeated when he emerged from the revolving door. In the meantime Stiller had spoken to his sick wife in the sanatorium. His account was brief and bald. 'That's all,' he concluded. 'Why are you so astounded?' It was true: the whole summer Sibylle had expected this, hoped for it, and silently encouraged it. And now it was a shock. She felt guilty. 'What about Julika?' she asked. 'What does she say about it?' This didn't seem to interest him. 'Separated?' she asked. 'What does that mean? You can't just leave her&#x2014;' Stiller appeared to her brutal, inhuman; his action horrified her. Now suddenly, for the first time, Julika was not a remote phantom, but a flesh-and-blood woman, a sick, unhappy, deserted woman, a sister. 'Stiller,' she said involuntarily, 'you shouldn't have done that...' She corrected herself: 'We've no right to do that. I'm to blame myself, I know that. It's madness, Stiller, it's murder...' Stiller was unperturbed, he seemed almost to derive a malicious satisfaction from her concern. Stiller fancied himself free, completely free, and for the moment it was enough for him that he had acted.</p>
<p>'I'm hungry,' he said and showed clearly enough that he had no wish to think any more about Julika, and no cause. They entered an inn full oflocals, railwaymen enjoying their evening after work, each of them with a <emph type="2">Brissago</emph> in his face and rather hushed by the lady's fur coat, till one of them said, 'Are we going to play or aren't we?' There was no menu printed in the style of the Gutenberg Bible here, but instead a fat innkeeper's wife who greeted them with a rather damp handshake, and then wiped a few small puddles of beer and some crumbs off the varnished wooden table. The price of the wines from the cask&#x2014;Veltline, Kalterer, Magdalener, Dole&#x2014;could be read on a blackboard attached to the wall, flanked by the laurel wreaths and cups of a rifle club and surmounted by the usual faded but colourful portrait of General Guisan. Stiller with his hunger was as confident as a woodcutter after a hard day's work, tired, unhurried, at one with himself, he immediately broke a loaf in two with his broad hands, while Sibylle, sitting on the bench by the tiled stove, suddenly found a purring cat on her lap waiting to be stroked. Stiller was delighted with the prospect of <emph type="2">Rb'sti</emph> and <!--leaf265:

While one of them shuffled the cards, the revelling railwaymen discussed the costly futility of a Big Four conference in a tone of conventional exasperation, without the least hint of real anger, and then became mute with concentration as the game started, diffusing a silence through the low bar-parlour that inevitably spread to Sibylle and Stiller. When the fat innkeeper's wife brought, not the impatiently awaited food, but the Veltliner, Stiller inquired about a room. 'Single or double?' asked the innkeeper's wife, as Stiller went out with her to look at the room...</p>
<p>For a time Sibylle was alone, the only woman in the bar, she turned the pages of a cycling magazine without reading it; a workman had sat down at her table; he licked the froth from his lips and eyed the lady with undisguised distrust, with downright contempt, as though he knew what the good Stiller did not for a moment suspect. How would Stiller take her confession, which seemed to her, as soon as she tried to frame it in words, simply incredible, monstrous! Sibylle was surprised that she had been able to look him in the eyes&#x2014;she had no difficulty in doing so, even when Stiller came back and sat down beside her, gay with hunger but not in the least put out by the fact that Sibylle, who had already eaten, only drank a kirsch. There had been an avalanche somewhere near Bergtin, they heard from the railwayman. But the rumour was exaggerated; Stiller had seen the avalanche in question and told the rather pompous men with <emph type="2">Brissagos</emph> in their brown faces that the line was already clear. Sibylle was surprised and somehow charmed, relieved, when she saw these revelling men, about whom there was something threatening in her eyes, disarmed by Stiller's nonchalant matter-of-factness. Sibylle felt protected. And the railwayman at their table had also stopped eyeing Sibylle with contempt; he even passed the ashtray without waiting to be asked. And later, after paying for his beer, he took off his cap and wished Stiller and Sibylle a good night 'together'. Once Stiller, as he ate, asked Sibylle: 'Is anything the matter?'&#x2014;'Why?'&#x2014;'You're very quiet today.'&#x2014;'I'm glad you've come,' said Sibylle. 'I was so furious with you, I thought you'd just gone off and left me.' She lifted the purring cat from her lap and dropped it to the ground, where it stuck its tail in the air. 'Why didn't you leave me any <!--leaf266: 
type:ital
 ( Scandale.)

 ( Celui-lal) page:265 (266) re:digit_letter (6m) re:letter_digit (d6) -->message?' said Sibylie. 'I did something stupid, I must tell you, something very stupid...'</p>
<p>Stiller went on eating and didn't expect anything serious. He had been to Davos, he had parted from the sick Julika; what could upset him now! He smiled: 'What did you do?' But now the fat innkeeper's wife came with coffee in two glasses, and Sibylie was relieved. She hadn't wanted to talk about it at all. There are things that happen and yet don't count, but once they have been put into words they do count, and all the time there is really no need for them to count. The black coffee in the glasses was just as they had feared, namely bitter, so hot that they burnt their tongues, and at the same time unutterably insipid, tasting of anything rather than coffee; they tried to make it drinkable with humour and plenty of sugar, but the sugar only rendered this brown and grey liquid completely nauseating. Now he told her about Paris. Why didn't she sink into the floor? She pretended to be listening. When Sibylie thought about the last two nights they seemed to her like a monstrous dream...</p>
<p>'By the way, I've brought you something from Paris,' Stiller broke into his account. 'Where on earth did I put it?' Sibylie meanwhile filled their glasses with Veltliner. 'You know all those perfumeries in the Place Vendome?' laughed Stiller and told her the story of how he looked for her scent. The famous Place Vend6me, a large square with arcades, is the citadel of the French perfume trade, every firm has its own shop there, so unless you know the maker of the scent you are looking for, you have to go from firm to firm having your fingers dabbed; Stiller had imagined he would smell out her scent from among hundreds. The young assistants were charming, dabbing their own little hands when Stiller had no more free fingers. Naturally he became more and more uncertain. The young ladies did not laugh at him for a moment, on the contrary, they were charmed by his meticulous gravity, although his French was not adequate to describing scents. Stiller made a note of the names. On his right index finger, for example, he had <emph type="2">Scandale.</emph> But in the course of the afternoon, his last afternoon in Paris, even the names became confused in his mind; he could only hold up his finger, <emph type="2">Celui-M</emph> Often even the assistants had difficulty in <!--leaf267:

And it's amazing how many perfumes there are; his hands were two palettes covered in scents, and Stiller walked with outspread fingers to prevent them from mingling. How much lay in the <emph type="2">nuance,</emph> what bliss and what torment. And on top of everything else the assistants wanted to know whether the perfume he was seeking was for a blonde or a brunette, or even a redhead? It makes a great deal of difference&#x2014;this was something Stiller didn't know before either&#x2014;the same perfume smells quite different on a different skin. Then what was the use of these young ladies with all the samples on their alien skin? Shortly before closing time he gave it up. During the evening, watching Jouvet (<emph type="2">&#xC9;cole des femmes)</emph> he almost forgot the whole business, Jouvet was so magnificent; but his hands hadn't left him, and during the interval Stiller started sniffing at one finger after the other once more. And again on the way home: he stopped in the middle of the street, took off his gloves, and sniffed. His nose was now fresh again, but now there was no difference between one finger and another, it was all one and hence hopeless. Finally he washed his hands and was just as wise as before he started. The following morning, just before the train left, he bought a perfume at random...</p>
<p>'I've no idea whether it's the right one,' said Stiller in some embarrassment, when he finally handed over the little packet, once very elegant, now a trifle tattered from its long stay in his trousers pocket, and waited for Sibylle to open it. <emph type="2">'Iris gris!'</emph> she laughed. 'Is that the right one?' he asked, while Sibylle immediately unscrewed the little bottle and rubbed a few drops on the back of her hand. I think <emph type="2">Iris gris</emph> is wonderful!' she said, and Stiller sniffed at her hand, the one and only hand at last, his disappointment growing at every breath. 'No,' he said, 'that's not it.' Sibylle sniffed too. 'But isn't it lovely?' she consoled him, without having to sham, and put the little bottle in her pocket. 'Thank you very much!'</p>
<p>Soon afterwards Stiller paid, and they emptied their glasses, without having reached any agreement as to whether Sibylle was going back to her hotel or not. What did he intend? Stiller seemed to have completely made up his mind, but to what?</p>

<p>'Drink up,' he said, without impatience, still seated but taking her fur coat from the nearby hook. 'It's not important,' remarked Sibylle, 'But I must tell you. It's really not important&#x2014;' His lack of curiosity made it even more difficult to find the right words; Stiller seemed to suspect nothing yet, nothing at all. Or did he already know and really consider it unimportant? 'I'm a goose,' she smiled. 'I took revenge, you see, took revenge in such a silly way, two nights in succession with two different men&#x2014;' Stiller didn't seem to hear, didn't seem to understand, he said nothing and didn't even wince; and then the fat innkeeper's wife came back with the change and took the opportunity of asking whether the lady and gentleman would like breakfast in their room or not. She stayed by their table as a gesture of hospitality. The relentless conversation about avalanches, the weather in general, and hotel-keeping after a world war, lasted almost ten minutes.</p>
<p>When they were at last alone together again, Stiller asked with her fur coat on his knees: 'What did you mean by that?' Sibylle looked at the beer mat he was twisting round on the table, and repeated it with a clarity which seemed to her now, however Stiller might take it, indispensable, her last chance to make a clean breast of things: 'Two nights in succession I slept with two different men&#x2014;that's what I mean...' Now he knew. And the future (thought Sibylle) now depended solely on Stiller's reaction to this monstrous trifle.</p>
<p>The revelling railwaymen threw down their cards, one of them wiped the slate clean with a sponge, now that it was settled who had to pay, and the commentary on the lost game, which there was no changing now, turned to yawns. It was eleven o'clock. With their railwaymen's caps already on their heads they, too, wished the couple, who were left alone in the bar-parlour, a good night 'together'. Stiller went on fiddling with the beer mat. 'I know that&#x2014;' he said. 'Only I never told anyone. Anyway, it was a long time ago. I knew perfectly well whom I loved, but all the same&#x2014;! I was actually on my way to her, yes, it was the eve of our reunion. I suddenly went into a skid&#x2014;in just the same way,' he said putting down the beer mat. 'I know that...' He had no more to say. 'Went into a skid,' this expression evidently consoled Sibylle greatly, it restored to her the <!--leaf269:

And that evening (so she says) she still believed it might be a road they could travel together.</p>
<p>This proved to be an error.</p>
<p>The following morning&#x2014;after a wretched night&#x2014;they said good-bye to one another at the little station of Pontresina. When the train at last began to move, Sibylle continued to stand like a statue on a plinth, and both of them, Stiller at the open window, Sibylle on the platform, waved a half-hearted farewell. (Since then Sibylle, my public prosecutor's wife, has never seen the missing Stiller again.) She herself walked slowly back to the hotel, asked for her bill, packed, and left the same day. It was impossible simply to return to Rolf now, she felt, and Redwood City seemed to be the solution; she had to work, to be alone, to earn her own living. Otherwise she would have felt a helpless victim, not knowing where she belonged; the road from woman to whore had proved astonishingly short. In Ziirich Rolf welcomed her with the opening remark that he was willing to have a divorce. Sibylle left it to him to make the necessary arrangements and asked his permission to take little Hannes with her to Redwood City. Their conversation was confined to the future, to practical problems. As regards Hannes, their joint son, it was difficult to decide what was best for the child himself: Rolf asked for twenty-four hours in which to think it over. Then to her amazement, he agreed. Sibylle thanked him by weeping on his hands, and shortly before Christmas, after being accompanied to the Central Station by her husband, left for Le Havre, where she embarked for America.</p>

<p align="left">America brought Sibylle a period of almost monastic solitude. She stayed in New York. When young Sturzenegger came over from California to fetch the secretary he really didn't need, Sibylle had already found another job&#x2014;thanks to her knowledge of European languages, a pretty good job. She was proud. <!--leaf270:

 (depen­) page:269 (270) -->And Sturzenegger, who didn't take it to heart, went back to his Redwood City alone after entertaining Sibylle to a French supper in Greenwich Village. There was no more skidding. The road, her road, was pretty hard. For the first time Sibylle, the daughter of rich parents, found herself in the same position as other people, namely alone and responsible for herself, dependent on her abilities, dependent on demand, dependent on the moods and good faith of an employer. Strangely enough, it gave her a sense of freedom. Her work was dull, she had to translate business letters into German, French, and Italian, always more or less the same ones. And the first home of her own she had ever had was such that even when the sun was shining outside she could scarcely read or sew without the electric light, hardly ever dared to open a window because everything immediately became covered in soot, and had to put wax in her ears in order to sleep. Sibylle was aware that millions of people lived in worse conditions than she and that therefore she had no right to complain. Complaint was altogether out of the question, if only because of Rolf. Fortunately, she was able to leave Hannes in a German-Jewish children's home during the day. She spent her free time, whenever the weather permitted, with Hannes in the nearby Central Park, where there were trees...</p>
<p>She began, as the saying goes, a new life.</p>
<p>Once, in February, Sibylle had a bit of a fright, though she doesn't know to this day whether the fright was based on mere fancy or on reality. They were sitting in Central Park again, Hannes and she, feeding the squirrels; the sun was warm, snow still lay in the shady hollows, the ponds were still partly frozen, but the birds were twittering and spring was on its way. The ground was damp; they were sitting on the slate-black Manhattan rock, and Sibylle was as merry as Rumpelstiltskin, so secret and incognito did she feel in this huge city. Between leafless branches they saw the familiar silhouettes of the skyscrapers in the bluish haze; at the edge of the great park, beyond the silence, there was a ghostly hum and every now and then the hoot of a siren came from way over on the Hudson. A policeman rode along in the black dusty earth of the bridle path. Boys were playing baseball. Here and there on the long benches sat a man reading a newspaper, or a pair of lovers <!--leaf271:

Sibylle enjoyed the fact that she knew nobody. She only saw the man, who walked past behind her, from the back, but for a moment she was absolutely certain it was Stiller, and Sibylle was within an ace of involuntarily calling out. Of course she talked herself out of it. How could Stiller be wandering about New York? A trace of disquiet remained, nonetheless, half hope, half fear that it might really be Stiller. Sibylle took Hannes by the hand and walked through the park, not to look for him but rather to run away; all the same, she had to go in the same direction. Of course, as she expected, she did not see the man again.</p>
<p>She had completely forgotten this figment of her imagination (as no doubt it was) when, a few days later, as she was being carried down into the subway on the escalator, she saw him being carried upwards. It was impossible to get off. Had he not stared at her, even if he had made no sign of greeting? The unlikelihood was her consolation. Or was Stiller trailing her? In any case, when he reached the top of the escalator, the man she had taken for Stiller did not walk on, but immediately crossed over to the escalator coming down. There was a terrible crush, which made calm observation impossible, quite apart from her inner turmoil. What did a U.S. Army greatcoat mean in America? Later Sibylle talked herself out of it again; she had stared so hard at the man on the escalator that he might have fancied his chances, although he didn't know Sibylle, and that was why he had turned back. Could be. At the moment Sibylle acted completely mechanically; she forced her way into the nearest compartment of some underground train or other, the doors closed and off they went. For a few weeks she felt nervous every time she went out into the street, but in vain; she never again saw a man who might have been confused with Stiller.</p>
<p>Her work, as I have said, was dull. She sat in a room devoid of daylight, convinced after a week that she couldn't stand this unnatural state of affairs. No idea whether it was raining outside or brilliant sunshine, no awareness of the time of the day, never a breath of air that smelt of storm or people or leaves or even of rain-wet asphalt&#x2014;and it was all the more frightful because Sibylle was absolutely the only one who missed anything: she <!--leaf272:

The certainty that it would be exactly the same in any better-class firm rendered her utterly helpless. What alternative had she but the diligence bom of desperation? As a result, she was highly valued, and when she gave notice after a year they kept her on by doubling her salary.</p>
<p>Now Sibylle was able to afford another, more cheerful apartment, two rooms with a so-called roof garden on Riverside Drive looking out on the broad Hudson. And here, on the eighteenth floor, she was blissfully happy. She and Hannes sunned themselves in the shelter of a red party-wall, from where they could see a great deal of sky and even some landscape&#x2014;forest. And to the east the sea. Even in the hazy distance Hannes could already distinguish whether it was the <emph type="2">he-de-France</emph> or the <emph type="2">Qjteen Mary</emph> coming into port. And in the evening, when darkness fell, the curving garland of lights on the Washington Bridge was right in front of their window. Here Sibylle lived for almost two years. The idea of returning to Switzerland occurred to her less and less often.</p>
<p>She liked life in America very much (she says) without being thrilled by it; she enjoyed its strangeness. Yet she had never seen the true America, the West. Sibylle planned to travel across to the opposite coast, to see Arizona, Texas, the flowers in California; but she was an employee, and that meant she could live, live well even, just so long as she sat in front of her typewriter and typed: in return she had the freedom of her week-ends, which covered a radius of no less than a hundred miles. She loved New York. During the first few weeks it seemed to her that nothing was easier than associating with Americans. They were all so open, so easy-going; she made more friendships, or so it seemed, than at any time in her life. She also enjoyed being so unmolested as a woman, indeed, it was as though on landing in America she had ceased to be a woman; in spite of all the sympathy people showed her they treated her as though she were completely neuter. After her recent experience this was a boon, of course, at least at first. And even later (so she says) she had no desire for a man, certainly not for an American man. She had 'friends', in the American sense; most of them had cars, and that was not unimportant, especially in summer, when it was so <!--leaf273:

In time, however, this lack of any atmosphere, such as exists even in Switzerland, began to irritate her. It was not easy to say what was really lacking. Everyone praised her new spring dress, her look of good health, her son; compared with Switzerland in particular, it was simply delightful how lavish people were with praise. But suddenly Sibylle wondered whether they so much as saw what they were praising at all. It was remarkable to discover (she says) how wonderful and great was the diversity of erotic play; Sibylle had never realized it so clearly as here, where this diversity doesn't exist. When she left a restaurant, when she left a subway, when she left a social gathering, she never had the feeling of being missed by a man in that enchanting way which somehow uplifts both parties, without their making an effort to see one another again. Never, in the street, did she encounter that quick glance of purposeless delight, never in conversation was there any hint of the exciting realization that people are divided into two sexes. Everything remained on a comradely level and as far as it went very nice; but a tension was missing, a wealth of subtle radiations, a playful artistry, a magic, a threat, the exciting possibility of living complications. It was flat, not unintelligent, heavens alive, the place was seething with cultured people; but it was lifeless, somehow without charm, naive. Then Sibylle felt like a woman under a cap of invisibility: seen by no one, no, not seen, they heard what she said and found it amusing, interesting, may be, but it was a meeting in a vacuum chamber. It was funny: they talked about 'sex problems' with such premature candour, with the enlightened frankness of eunuchs who don't know what they are talking about. Nobody here seemed to see any difference between sex and eroticism. And when they took their exuberant deficiency for health, no, it wasn't always funny, it was tedious. What had New York not got to offer! It was a shame to be bored here. The concerts alone! But life itself, everyday existence, shopping, lunch at the drugstore, travelling by bus, waiting at a station, the hustle and bustle that makes up nine-tenths of our life, was so immensely practical, so intensely lustreless.</p>
<p>Sibylle often went into the Italian quarter, to buy vegetables she said; in reality she went to see, hungry for something worth <!--leaf274: 
type:ent
 (th re­) page:273 (274) -->seeing. Or did the fault lie with Sibylle? After about half a year she had the bitter feeling that she had disappointed everyone. She had a little book full of addresses, but she no longer dared ring anybody up. How had she disappointed all these friendly friends? She didn't know and nobody told her. She was seriously depressed by it. Meanwhile, and this perplexed Sibylle even more, she had forfeited nothing; if she met one of her friends by chance, they said Hallo Sibylle! just like the first time, and there was no trace of disappointment on the other side. Apparently all these frank and easy-going people did not expect anything else from a human relationship; there was no need for this friendly relationship to go on growing. That was the saddest thing for Sibylle: after twenty minutes you have got as far with these people as after half a year, as after many years, nothing more is added. Friendship stops at sincere good wishes for the other's well-being. People have friends simply to make life pleasant, and then there are psychiatrists, like motor mechanics for the inner life, if a person has defects and cannot patch himself up. Anyhow, you shouldn't burden your friends with a gloomy face; in fact they have nothing else to give than a quite general and non-committal optimism. It was better to lie in the sun in the little roof garden. And yet, in spite of all the trouble Sibylle had with this carefree lack of content that characterizes the vast majority of Americans, she was far from the idea of returning to Switzerland...</p>
<p>After a correspondence that had gradually died away, after a mutual silence that threatened to become final, Rolf, her husband, rang her one afternoon at her office. 'Where are you speaking from?' she asked. 'Here,' answered Rolf, 'at La Guar-dia. I've just landed. How can I meet you?' He had to wait till five o'clock, since Sibylle couldn't simply walk out, and in the end it was getting on for six when Sibylle, the secretary, appeared in the agreed hotel lobby on Times Square. 'How are you?' they asked one another. 'Fine, thank you,' they both replied. Sibylle led him across Times Square. 'How long are you staying here?' she asked; but naturally they could scarcely talk in the crush. She took Rolf, the bewildered newcomer, up the Rockefeller Tower to show him something of New York right away. 'Are you in New York on business?' she asked and then <!--leaf275:

 ( thou­)

 (y col­) page:274 (275) -->corrected herself: 'I mean professionally?' They were sitting in the famous Rainbow Bar and had to order something. 'No,' said Rolf, i'm here on your account. On our account...'</p>
<p>They found one another pretty much unchanged, only a little older. Sibylle showed him the latest snap of Hannes. 'He's no kid any more, no, he's a regular guy already!' Rolf cut her short after a bit. 'I've come,' he said, 'to ask you&#x2014;I mean, either we must get a divorce or we must live together. But once and for all.' They didn't ask one another anything else. 'In which direction do you live?' inquired Rolf, and Sibylle showed him the district, pointing out the play of lights, the incredibly colourful dusk over Manhattan; but not everybody finds the woman of his life again as he is looking at it...</p>
<p>'Babylon,' exclaimed Rolf, who had to look down again and again at this net of shimmering strings of beads, this skein of light, this endless flowerbed of electric blossoms. One is astonished that in these depths down below, whose sounds are no longer audible, in this labyrinth of rectangular windows threaded by gleaming canals, which is repeated over and over again with no change, a person does not get lost every minute; that this never-ending movement from one place to another does not stop for a moment, or pile up into a hopeless chaos. Here and there it is dammed up into a pond filled with a white-hot glow&#x2014;Times Square, for instance. The skyscrapers tower black all round, vertical, yet spread out from one another by perspective like a cluster of crystals, larger and smaller crystals, thicker and thinner. At times trails of brightly coloured mist drift past, as though one were sitting on a mountain top, and for a while there is no more New York: the Atlantic has engulfed it. Then it is there again, half order as though on a chessboard, half confusion as though the Milky Way had fallen down from the sky. Sibylle pointed out the districts whose names she knew: Brooklyn behind a curtain of bridges, Staten Island, Harlem. Later everything became even more colourful; the skyscrapers no longer rose like black towers before the yellow dusk, now it was as though the night had swallowed up their bodies, and what remained were the lights in them, the hundreds of thousands of electric light bulbs, a screen of whitish and yellowish windows, nothing else, thus they hovered above the bright haze <!--leaf276: 
type:ent
 (judge­) page:275 (276) re:oddchar_endp (y&lt;/p&gt;) -->that was roughly the colour of apricots, and in the streets, as though in canyons, ran streams of glittering quicksilver.</p>
<p>Rolf could not get over his amazement. The ferries over the Hudson reflected in the water, the garlands of the bridges, the stars above a flood of neon lemonade, of sweetness, of sickliness, that attained the level of the grandiose, vanilla and raspberry, interspersed with the purple pallor of autumn crocuses, the green of glaciers, a green such as occurs in retorts, interspersed with the milk of dandelions, frippery and visions, yes, and beauty, oh, a fairy-like beauty, a kaleidoscope out of the kindergarten, a mosaic of coloured fragments, but mobile, yet at the same time lifeless and cold as glass, then again the Bengal lights of a stage Witches' Sabbath, a heavenly rainbow that has fallen into a thousand splinters and been scattered over the earth, an orgy of discord, of harmony, an orgy of the everyday, technological and mercantile above all; you immediately think of the Arabian Nights, of carpets, but carpets that glow, of worthless gems, of a child's firework that has fallen on the ground and continues to flicker; you have seen it all before, perhaps behind closed eyes in a fever; here and there it is also red, not red like blood, thinner, red like the light reflected in a glass of red wine when the sun shines in, red and also yellow like honey, thinner, yellow like whisky, greenish yellow like sulphur and certain fungi, strange, but all of it possessing a beauty which, if it were to become sound, would be the song of the sirens; yes, that's about how it is, sensual and lifeless at the same time, intelligent and stupid and powerful, an edifice of human beings or termites, symphony and lemonade, you have to have seen it to imagine it, but to have seen it with your eyes, notmerely with your judgement, seen it as one who is confused, benumbed, astounded, blissful, unbelieving, carried away, a stranger on earth, not merely a stranger in America; you can smile at it, shout for joy over it, weep over it. And far out to the east rises the bronze moon, a hammered disk, a silent gong...</p>
<p>But the most bewildering thing for Rolf was naturally Sibylle, his wife, who was at home here. They drank their martinis&#x2014;rather mute&#x2014;occasionally looking at one another, smiling almost with a touch of scorn as they realized that there was really no need to have an Atlantic between them. Rolf scarcely <!--leaf277: page:276 (277) re:openp_lowercase (&lt;p&gt;d) -->dared to take hold of her arm that lay so close to him; his tenderness stayed in his eyes, Sibylle, too, felt that the world, big as it was, held no one who could be closer to her than Rolf, her husband; she didn't deny it. Nevertheless, she asked for twenty-four hours in which to think it over.</p>

<title>SEVENTH NOTEBOOK</title>
<p align="left">W<emph type="6">ENT</emph> to the dentist today.</p>
<p>They are trifles and the terrible thing is that you don't defend yourself against trifles. You get tired of it. At the very outset, the white-overalled receptionist came into the waiting room and said, 'This way please, Herr Stiller.' Was I to bawl at her in front of all the other patients? She couldn't help it, this nice little person&#x2014;I was booked as Herr Stiller. So I followed her without a murmur. I owe all this to my defence counsel. They hung the white cloth round my neck, gave me a fresh glass, filled it with tepid water, all in the friendliest fashion, and the young dentist&#x2014;the successor of the deceased dentist to whom the vanished Stiller owes an outstanding account&#x2014;soaped his hands. He couldn't help it either: as far as the patient's name was concerned, he had to rely entirely on his receptionist, especially as he didn't know the inherited clientele yet.</p>
<p>'Herr Stiller,' he said, 'you've got toothache?'</p>
<p>I was just rinsing my mouth, nodded with reference to the toothache, and before I could rectify the mistake he had already found with his probe the spot where all discussion ended for me. The young man was very painstaking.</p>
<p>'Look,' he said, showing me with his little mirror, 'a crown like that, for example, left upper six&#x2014;can you see?&#x2014;I don't want to say anything against my predecessor, but one just can't do a crown like that.'</p>
<p>He misunderstood the expression in my eyes, thinking I wanted to stand up for his predecessor. With my mouth full of cotton wool and matrix bands and saliva ejectors, so that I couldn't contradict, I listened to his no doubt very interesting exposition of the new advances in dental surgery. Although the young man had taken over his uncle's practice and clients, he had no intention of also taking over the mistakes of the generation that had just passed away; and my mouth seemed to contain very little else but mistakes. Only with helpless glances could I beg the young man not to regard my crown as the work of his <!--leaf279:

<p>'Fraulein&#x2014;give me Herr Stiller's X-rays again.'</p>
<p>All this, as I have said, I owed to my defending counsel. Nobody believes me; every time the probe touched a certain spot, a few involuntary tears welled up from my eyes, and I couldn't think why he had to keep on probing this spot. At last he said.</p>
<p>'Yes, yes&#x2014;it's alive.'</p>
<p>The fact was, judging from the old X-rays which they had found in his predecessor's file, the young dentist simply couldn't understand how my left lower four could possibly be still alive, though in my opinion it was quite sensitive enough even if on the X-ray (they showed me Stiller's left lower four) it looked exactly like a dead root.</p>
<p>'Curious,' he murmured, 'curious.'</p>
<p>Then he rang through to the receptionist.</p>
<p>'Are those really Herr Stiller's X-rays?' he asked. 'Are you quite sure?'</p>
<p>'The name is on them&#x2014;'</p>
<p>His professional conscience left him no peace: he made another tooth-by-tooth comparison, which showed that Stiller, the vanished patient of his deceased uncle must, for instance, have had a perfect right upper eight, while in my case there was a gap. What had I done with my (Stiller's) right upper eight? I shrugged my shoulders. I wasn't going to submit to an interrogation with a mouthful of cotton wool and matrix bands and saliva ejectors, Finally the X-rays disappeared and the young dentist reached for the drill. After an hour and a half, when at last I had no more clamps in my mouth and was allowed to rinse it, I naturally had no further wish to resume discussion of the old X-rays. I merely asked for Saridone. Knobel was sitting in the waiting room. The grey prison van was standing under an avenue of acacias. The drivers had been told to park it somewhere out of sight. But since the avenue belonged to a school, whose playground it bordered, and since the main break was just in progress, Knobel and I were naturally surrounded by all the children in the school when we returned to the van. A little fellow asked me shyly if I was the thief. A girl shouted in <!--leaf280:

<p>I can't help thinking (I don't know what makes me do so) of the Day of the Dead as I saw it on Janitzio, of the Indian mothers crouching all night long over the graves, everyone in their gala clothes, carefully combed as though for a wedding, although apparently nothing happens; the cemetery is a terrace overlooking the black sea and overhung by steep crags, a cemetery without a single tombstone or any other sign&#x2014;everyone in the village knows where his dead lie, where he himself will one day lie. Candles are set up, three or seven or twenty, according to the number of dead souls, and alongside them the plates containing all kinds of foods and covered with a clean cloth, but the main thing is a strange object constructed with all the loving care of a Christmas present&#x2014;a frame of bamboo on which are set the cakes and flowers, the fruits, the bright-coloured sweetmeats. The dead are supposed to feed all night long on the scent of these foodstuffs, for the scent is the essence of things: this is the significance of the ceremony. Only women and children perform these nocturnal rites in the cemetery; the men pray in the church. The women, whose actions remain quite matter-of-fact and sober, settle down as though for a long rest, throwing a shawl over their heads so that woman and child, both under the same shawl, look like a single creature. The candles, lined up in rows between the living and the dead, flicker in the cold night wind, hour after hour, while the moon rises above the sombre mountains and sinks again in a lazy arc.</p>

<p>Nothing else happens. Every now and then the clanging of a bell is carried over by the wind, or the wailing sound of a dog howling at the moon; otherwise nothing. Nobody weeps, there is little talking, only what is essential is said, but then not in whispers as is the way in our cemeteries; there is no question of any special atmosphere here. The silence, to which even the children submit, as they gaze for hours on end into the candles or into the empty night over the sea, is not reverence, not depth of emotion as we understand it, neither in a good nor in a bad sense. It is simply silence. In face of the fact of life and death there is nothing whatever to be said. A few even sleep, while their dead, father or husband or son, feed soundlessly on the scent, on the essence of things. The last-comers arrive towards midnight; no one will leave the graves until dawn. The dead souls flicker in thousands. A shivering child, who is coughing very ominously, as though anxious to join the dead, is allowed to sample the sweetmeats already, although the food still belongs to the dead. On the whole, they are strangely patient. And it is cold, it is the night of the first of November. A little girl, whose mother is dozing, plays with a candle, making warm drops of wax fall on her hand until the candle goes out, and then relighting it. Every breath of wind is heavily laden with scent; the women pluck to pieces yellow flowers and scatter them in the direction of the dead&#x2014;much as one prepares vegetables, not negligently, but without unnecessary gestures, with emphasis, with solemnity, without any dramatic expression to indicate that some symbolic significance is intended. The whole ceremony is not intended at all, but simply performed. And it is as though the silence grew yet more silent. The moon has gone down, the cold is cutting. Nothing happens. The women do not kneel, but sit on the ground, so that the soul of the dead may rise into their wombs. That is all, until day breaks, a night of silent patience, a surrender to the inescapable process of death and growth&#x2014;</p>

<p align="left">A conversation with the public prosecutor, my friend, about Stiller.</p>
<p>'The overwhelming majority of human lives are ruined by <!--leaf282: page:281 (282) -->the fact that people make excessive demands on themselves,' he said and explained what he meant like this: 'Our consciousness has changed a great deal in the course of a few centuries, our emotional life much less. Hence there is a discrepancy between the level of our intellect and that of our emotions. Most of us have a parcel of flesh-pink cloth&#x2014;namely, our feelings&#x2014;that from our intellectual level we should like to ignore. There are two ways out of the difficulty that lead nowhere: either we kill our primitive and therefore unworthy feelings, as far as we can, at the risk of killing our emotional life altogether, or we simply give our unworthy feelings another name. We lie about them, disguise them as something else. We label them to satisfy the wishes of our consciousness. The more adroit our consciousness, the better-read, the more numerous and nobler-looking are our back-doors, the cleverer our self-deception. You can entertain yourself like that for a lifetime, excellently in fact, only you never reach life that way; it leads inescapably to loss of contact with your own personality. For example, we can easily call our lack of the courage to go down on our knees good breeding, our fear of self-realization unselfishness and so on. Most of us know only too well what we ought to feel in this, that, or the other situation, or, as the case may be, must not feel, but even with the best will in the world we have great difficulty in finding out what we actually do feel. That is a bad state of affairs. A sarcastic attitude towards all emotion is its classical symptom ... Excessive demands on oneself are inevitably linked with the wrong kind of bad conscience. One man blames himself for not being a genius, another blames himself for not being a saint in spite of his good upbringing, and Stiller blamed himself for not being the sort who could fight in Spain ... It is extraordinary what we mistake for conscience, once we have begun making excessive demands upon ourselves and so losing touch with our own personalities. The famous inner voice is often enough no more than the coquettish voice of a pseudo-ego that does not allow me to finally give up trying, to recognize myself, and attempts with all the wiles of vanity, if necessary even with false voices from heaven, to bind me to my fatal habit of making excessive demands upon myself. We can see our defeats, but we do not understand them as signals, as the outcome of <!--leaf283:

<p>We then discussed the well known line: Him I love who craves the impossible. Without being able to recall just where this line occurs in <emph type="2">Faust,</emph> Part Two, we agreed that it could only have been uttered by a demonic figure; for it is an invitation to neurosis and has nothing to do with any real endeavour (it doesn't refer to endeavour, anyhow, but to craving) that presupposes humility in the face of our limited potentialities.</p>
<p>'I don't see Stiller as an exception,' said my public prosecutor. 'I see some of my acquaintances and myself in him, although the demands we make on ourselves are of different kinds ... Many know themselves, only a few also manage to accept themselves. How much self-knowledge is limited to presenting other people with a more precise and exact description of our weaknesses&#x2014;a form of coquetry. But even genuine self-knowledge, which remains mute and is chiefly expressed in behaviour, is not enough; it is a first step, indispensable and laborious, but not sufficient in itself. Self-knowledge in the form of lifelong melancholy, of amused indulgence towards our early resignation is very common, and people of this kind may sometimes be very pleasant table companions; but what is it like for them? They have given up a false role, and that is certainly something, but it doesn't yet take them back into life ... It is not true that self-acceptance automatically comes with age. It is true that when we are older our earlier aims seem more dubious and it is easier, cheaper, more painless to smile at our youthful ambition; but this is not the same as self-acceptance. In a certain respect, even, it becomes more difficult as we get older. More and more people to whom we look up admiringly are younger than ourselves, our allotted span grows shorter and shorter, resignation becomes easier and easier in view of our nonetheless honourable career, easier still for those who have had no career at all and can console themselves with the ill-will of their environment, cheering themselves with the thought of their unrecognized genius ... To accept oneself calls for an extremely positive attitude towards life ... The demand that we shall love our neighbour <!--leaf284:

<p align="left">The mother's grave. It is just like all graves in this country: neatly enclosed by a granite border, every grave a little too short so that you're afraid of treading on the dead people's feet, gravel paths in between, evergreens round the edge, in the centre of the grave an earthenware vase containing a few withered asters, behind the headstone a rusty tin for watering flowers. But today it was raining. We stood together under the umbrella, and the church clock struck three. The headstone was a bit queer, a typical piece of tombstone art, some kind of <!--leaf285: 
type:ent
 (al Co­) page:284 (285) re:oddchar_endp (:&lt;/p&gt;) -->allegory. Here and there a small cypress towered above this grey Manhattan of tombstones. Once Wilfried asked:</p>
<p>'How do you like the stone, by the way?'</p>
<p>'Yes,' I said...</p>
<p>One would expect Wilfried to possess an umbrella. I've never had an umbrella of my own in my life, but now I was glad of an umbrella. It was a country cemetery, an insignificant church dating from the nineteenth century, situated on a hilltop and surrounded by ancient elms. In good weather one would no doubt have a pretty, quiet, wide view out over the lake towards the mountains. Today everything was grey, a dripping autumn day with mist hanging round the woods. We stood there for a long time, while the rain drummed on the black umbrella, both of us without speaking and without making a gesture, like any two Protestants. The inscription read: Here rests in God. Others had other inscriptions, Rest in peace, or else some vague lyric. The headstone, travertine, was slightly polished. The rain dripped audibly from the umbrella on to brown leaves. In the next row but one there was a fresh grave, a mound of loamy earth with wreaths on top of it. Then the church clock struck again. It was cold, wet, grey...</p>
<p>Afterwards we went to a tavern.</p>
<p>Wilfried Stiller, younger than I, is a hefty fellow with a tanned, rough, and taut skin. You can see at once that he spends a lot of time in the sun and air. His black hair is cropped short like a peasant's or a soldier's. He brought me over in a jeep that belongs not to him personally, but to the Agricultural Cooperative. He is manager of the fruit section...</p>
<p>Naturally we talked about our mothers, while Wilfried smoked cigars all the time (except in the cemetery), the same brand as the inspector at the police station when I first arrived. Apparently his mother was extremely strict, mine not in the least. When Wilfried told me how his mother shut him up for a whole day in the cellar, because he had been pinching jam and she wanted to give him a lasting distaste for the place, I could laugh with the man who survived that day in a dark cellar with undiminished good health; but that wasn't my mother. She could never have brought herself to be so strict. His mother used to say: 'Now pull yourself together, if you want to be a proper <!--leaf286:

My mother was convinced that I should cope with life all right. I can remember listening at the keyhole as my mother told a group of friends all the witty and clever remarks I had made during the past week, enjoying a great success with them.</p>
<p>Nothing like that ever happened to Wilfried; his mother was worried that Wilfried would never achieve anything worthwhile, and the healthy man sitting opposite me at the varnished tavern table smoking a cigar, rather rough but cordial in his dullness, admitted himself that he was not a gifted child: he hadn't even learnt to play the piano. My mother, I know, saved on charwomen and washerwomen and did the cleaning and washing herself, so that she could pay for my flute lessons every month; for I was considered gifted.</p>
<p>Both mothers were funny! Wilfried told me that his mother, who was naturally just as respectable as mine, loved raw liver above everything else, far more than sweets. Now, no one could give her a packet of raw liver for her birthday or mother's day, so she had to buy her tit-bits for herself. And so she did. Once, when a football had been kicked into some bushes and Wilfried went to look for it, he found his mother in the most hidden corner of a public park, eating raw liver; the good woman was frightened to death, and obliged to keep Wilfried at bay with any excuse she could think of, until he believed anything of his mother&#x2014;except that she had been eating raw liver!</p>
<p>When Wilfried recalled incidents like this, it might have been my mother too, and we laughed together. Then again he described a mother whom I did not know at all, a clear-thinking and incorruptible woman whom you couldn't hoax, a practical woman who accustomed Wilfried at an early age to the idea that he would never be able to marry a proper woman if he didn't earn plenty of money. My mother wasn't like that at all. She enjoyed it when I hoaxed her, and as regards the future she attached more importance to my inner qualities, convinced that I could marry anyone I liked, any woman whatever with the exception of my fond mother herself, which when I was young I regretted; my mother's worry was rather whether the person I should one day bring home would really be worthy of me. Once, I remember, I tried to spit cherry stones on to our old neighbour <!--leaf287: page:286 (287)

My stepfather used to say that my mother and I stuck together like burrs. Wilfried had his own father. And my mother, I know, would never have cried in front of teachers; she would have denied everything or demanded a little understanding on the part of the teachers. I was a delicate child. When my mother, God knows how, paid the police fine, I brought her a whole lot of cowslips; that was when my mother cried, not before. His mother didn't expect any cowslips, but told Wilfried to apologize personally to the teacher he had been rude to. It's funny how different mothers can be!...</p>
<p>'Now she's been lying over there four years already,' said Wilfried. 'Anything rather than be buried in the town, anything rather than lie alongside people she had never seen while she was alive, she didn't like the idea of that&#x2014;'</p>
<p>Once the taverner came, addressed Wilfried by name, and then shook my hand too. Wilfried talks to people without the least trace of disguise. I can't do that. Why not? And then, when we were alone together again, I had to tell him about Julika&#x2014;how she was getting on in Paris. Julika came here from Paris for the funeral with her red hair. Wilfried had not met her again since. Wilfried was wearing a knitted waistcoat. He was very interested in California; Wilfried once wanted to go and farm in Argentina, but couldn't because of his mother, so I talked about California, without thinking or seeing California; I saw rather the grave with the evergreens and polished travertine, without thinking or seeing my mother, and for Wilfried everything was fine.</p>
<p>His brother, the missing man, must always have been rather odd. He didn't say so, didn't even hint it. Wilfried is not ambiguous, not subtle, not inquisitive; he is a man of natural existence, not a man of expression. Even when I keep silent, I feel like a chatterbox beside him. Wilfried drank little and probably even that was only for my benefit, yet he found the wine good, which I for my part found touching, for it was a mediocre wine, with no body, really tasting only of cask. And all this was very normal, very strange, a conversation with <!--leaf288:

He was a brother, which I wasn't, and it didn't even worry him that I wasn't.</p>
<p>Was I also hungry? Wilfried didn't try to convince me of anything, and there was something disarming about this. And he wasn't afraid of silence, whereas I resumed the conversation about modern farms in California, a subject on which Wilfried was far better informed than I, through his reading. We made one amusing discovery: the illustrated paper that contained the article about the dancer Julika and her vanished husband also carried a long report on modern methods of pest control, which set Wilfried laughing when I referred to it in conversation; even over this matter, the paper didn't have the facts right. This amused me.</p>
<p>Whenever anything we discussed (military service, for example) brought to light the fact that Wilfried was five years younger than I, it irritated me. I saw him as a small boy sees men, as ageless but under all circumstances superior. It also irritated me that this man, for his part, was not irritated by even the oddest diversity of our natures, but immediately took it for granted that my life, though incomprehensible to him, was certain to be perfectly all right in my own eyes; and somehow, by not poking his nose into my affairs, he maintained a respectful distance, which every time I observed it made me feel ashamed and unsure of myself. But he was perfectly serious about this respect. I didn't dare order any more wine, any different wine, although I knew quite well that Wilfried would have raised no objection&#x2014;after all, it was a special day that deserved a little celebration.</p>
<p>Of his children, I heard that they had got over the mumps one after the other; there was nothing left now but measles. When Wilfried, after first hanging his jacket over the back of the chair, ate bread and cheese to fortify himself for the long journey in the not exactly comfortable jeep, I wondered whether I should not, even unasked, declare myself&#x2014;but I didn't know how, nor actually why either ...

Supposing I don't return to my cell at six? Wilfried drove me to Bellevue; he still had a long journey in front of him and tomorrow another hard day's work, on the other hand I had another hour's parole provided Wilfried stayed with me. He shook hands.</p>
<p>'Yes,' I said,'&#x2014;and supposing I make a getaway?'</p>
<p>He laughed, his hand already on the brake.</p>
<p>'That's up to you,' he commented, his jeep jerked and he was away ... What should I have explained to him? There are many people to whom I am. closer, in understanding much closer, than to this man; as a friend he is out of the question. He has his own friends, who are completely strange to me, and I don't think it would occur to him to number me among his friends. And yet he is the only person who can take it for granted that I am the missing Stiller, that is to say fundamentally misunderstand me, without my caring. What does understand mean anyway?

And yet I believe that no one writes without the idea that somebody is going to read what he writes, if this somebody is only the writer himself. Then I ask myself, Can one write without playing a part? One tries to be a stranger to oneself. My reality does not lie in the part I play, but in the unconscious decision as to what kind of part I assign myself. At times I have the feeling that one emerges from what has been written as a snake emerges from its skin. That's it; you cannot write yourself down, you can only cast your skin. But who is going to be interested in this dead skin? The ever-recurring question whether the reader is ever able to read anything other than himself is superfluous: writing is not communication with readers, not even communication with oneself, but communication with the inexpressible. The more exactly one succeeds in expressing oneself, the more clearly appears the inexpressible force, that is to say the reality, that oppresses and moves the writer. We possess language in order to become mute. He who is silent is not mute. He who is silent hasn't even an inkling who he is not.</p>

<p>They are all of them very pleasant people, although on this visit, gathered together as probably never happens under natural circumstances, they were rather like a funeral party at the crematorium. The fact was that, apart from their connexion with the missing Stiller, a connexion with such various origins, they really had nothing in common with one another. Each of them had perhaps heard of the others in the past through Stiller, whose absence was now painfully evident. We should have got to know one another <emph type="2">t&#xEA;te-&#xE0;-t&#xEA;te.</emph> One of them, I learnt after a time, had in the meantime become a professor, a fine brain who must have had a lot of trouble with the missing Stiller, so vague in mind and temperament and so full of muddle-headed radicalism. That he had come at all, this young professor, who naturally had other friends than Stiller, was an act of true loyalty. His circumspection, the tender consideration with which he treated me, enabled me to guess how sensitive the missing Stiller must have been; and as a matter of fact I, too, felt inferior, felt the extent of my ignorance, relapsed into a kind of timid esteem and hence into a tone that must inevitably have reminded him of his vanished friend. He didn't want this tone or this silence of timid esteem; but it seemed as though he were used to it, and the stranger my behaviour, the more certainly he must have seen in me the vanished Stiller, who had often enough struck him as strange and with whom he had kept faith, in spite of everything, more out of a desire for fair play than out of friendship, which never bore fruit with Stiller.</p>
<p>Why did it make me sad? They were all the sort of men one would like to have for one's friends. Why wasn't it possible? Incidentally, they were by no means agreed as to who Stiller was; and yet they acted as though they took me for one and the same person. A lively graphic artist already described the celebration that was to take place after my release, and the fifth, a compositor by trade, seemed to be a Communist who regarded the other four as arrant reactionaries and blamed me for talking to them, to judge by his expression. He was particularly annoyed with me over the friendly tone in which the property <!--leaf292:

<p>The actor, I observed, had become a Catholic and looked down, not without respect, not without understanding, upon the compositor, the Communist, whose views he had no difficulty in guessing, since they reminded him of the first intellectual adventures of his own youth. Apart from the Communist, it was obvious that none of them had stood still. The young professor assured me that, although he still valued the classics above all else, he no longer regarded modern art as purely decadent, and the graphic artist, manifestly converted by a considerable degree of success, had shaken off all pessimism concerning contemporary culture, pointed to the high level of Swiss graphic art and for his part, speaking frankly, had no need of either Communism or Catholicism in order to see his task in the world. The property owner, on the other hand, an antique dealer by profession, was more than ever attached to tradition, the more local the better, not a word against the European Defence Community, but for that very reason it was the antiquarian's duty to foster the sense of difference, for example the difference between the inhabitants of Basle and those of Z&#xFC;rich; for what were Europe's fraternal armies to defend if not the prerogative of being different, even over very short distances?</p>
<p>As I have said, they were the pleasantest of people. Afterwards, I asked myself why I couldn't really feel myself their friend. I have offended them, without saying anything. My cell grows lonelier after every visit.</p>

<p align="left">It is hard not to tire in the face of the world, in the face of its majority, in the face of its superiority, which there is no denying. It is difficult, alone and without witnesses, to know what one believes one has learnt in a solitary hour, difficult to carry a knowledge that can never be proved nor even uttered. I know I am not the missing Stiller. And I never was. I swear it, even if I do not know who else I am. Perhaps I am no one. And even if they can prove to me in black and white that of all people who are registered as having been born, only one is at present missing, Stiller, and that I am not in this world at all if I refuse to be Stiller, I shall still refuse. Why don't they give up trying? My behaviour is ludicrous, I know, my position is becoming untenable.

<p align="left">That's not true. I cannot be alone, strictly speaking, and there has hardly been an hour in my life when I was able to be alone. Most of the time, strictly speaking, there was a woman present. It began with my dear, good mother. I just managed to scrape through my school-leaving certificate and I was glad on my mother's account, because my step-father couldn't say, 'Well, what about your precious son now?'

A host of hours, more hours than go to make a human life one would have thought, are on call in my memory, hours which I thought solitary&#x2014;evenings in hotel rooms with a hubbub rising from foreign streets or a view into a courtyard, nights spent on railway stations, spring days in a public park filled with prams and a foreign language, then again afternoons in my usual pub, wanderings in rain and forest and in the certainty that I should never again speak to some person for whom I yearned, partings of all kinds, quick, clean, and straightforward partings, but also pitiable, whimpering, dragged-out, cowardly partings&#x2014;a host of hours, as I said, and yet I was never alone, strictly speaking, not for an hour. I always found some inner escape route, a tender or tormented recollection, a passionate conversation with an invisible person who generally didn't exist at all, but whom I invented in order not to be alone, or the hope of a magnificent encounter at the next street-corner or the next street-corner but one. Is that solitude?</p>
<p>Right at the beginning of my artistic activity, perhaps, I was alone, or almost succeeded in being alone in a real sense in the hope of being able to realize myself in clay or plaster; but this hope did not last long before ambition raised its head, delight at the prospect of recognition, worry over possible rejection, for months all this clay and ambition and plaster kept me from seeing a single living soul, immersed in my art that never became real art, immured between the four walls of my studio, a hermit without a radio as in the Middle Ages, taciturn as a galley slave, a monk in relation to girls, but only in relation to them, a jubilant Rumpelstiltskin at the thought that nobody yet had any inkling of my genius; and I was as hard-working as a flogged beast, flogged by ambition. So I was not alone.</p>
<p>And I was not alone by my ferry across the Tajo; in the event of my death, I knew, Anya would not break down nor enter a convent, she would go on tending the living and go on letting herself be loved, but occasionally she would remember me. And when no one shot me, when they only tied me up with my braces, tied my hands and feet together and threw me into the gorse, I wasn't alone: I had my ignominy in front of Anya, I <!--leaf295: 
type:ent
 (itari­) page:294 (295) re:comma_no_space (,&lt;/p&gt;) -->thought I should die miserably of thirst and never see Anya again; I shouted as long as I could, then I stopped shouting, but on the threshold of unconsciousness I had Anya, my searing ignominy in front of Anya. And I was not alone on my way back, although I already had a presentiment how foreign my homeland would seem to me; I spent whole nights on the march or in French waiting-rooms justifying myself to Anya, feeling ashamed before Anya, becoming indignant about her or piling up hostile thoughts about her. I wasn't alone.</p>
<p>And then, far away from her, I told my Spanish tale; my acquaintances believed it, more or less, but I knew who knew the truth&#x2014;namely, Anya&#x2014;so I wasn't alone. It's ridiculous but true: there was always a woman with whom I could delude myself. I had men friends, not many, sometimes one, sometimes others; that was friendship, but no delusion about the solitariness as individuals. I often thought of distant friends, curious about their ideas or glad of their contradiction or even in painful discord; but in the hour of horror, in the hour of inability to be alone, it was never with anyone but a woman, with the memory or the hope of a woman, that I escaped from my loneliness. Why wasn't I capable of being alone, why was I compelled to bore myself with this ballerina, so much so that I even had to marry this sea beast? The fault was in myself, no doubt about that, time and again I was governed by an iron will operating in reverse. A thousand and one nights, at least, I took my head in my hands and fell asleep: even in marriage I couldn't be alone. I deserted her; she humiliated me and I humiliated her; but I wasn't alone.</p>
<p>And I wasn't alone stowed away in the after hold of an Italian tramp steamer, an emigrant without papers bound for America; only a bribed stoker knew I was down below among the barrels, and it was dark, stinking, and so hot that the sweat ran out of my every pore (it would have run out of anyone's in my place!); I knew very well that the beautiful Julika would be disgusted by this sweat&#x2014;so I wasn't alone. It was the chance of a lifetime to be alone, an opportunity of eighteen undisturbed days and nineteen nights with a calm sea most of the time, so I can't even make the excuse that I felt seasick. I was sick once, probably soon after we passed Gibraltar; the boat pitched for a few hours, <!--leaf296:

 (e rid­) page:295 (296) -->then quietened down again. And what did I do with my chance, that was as big as the Atlantic? I lit a cigarette and saw by the flame of my lighter the labels on the nearest barrels, Chianti Italian Wine Imported, then nothing but blank darkness with a few slits of light between the planks and the throbbing of the propeller-shaft underneath me, day and night; it was enough to drive one mad; I didn't go mad, for in imagination I saw Julika on her <emph type="2">art nouveau</emph> veranda and told her what still remained to be said. I was glad I should never see this woman again; that was my only pleasure down there in the hold. Was I alone? Every time I woke up after a longish sleep I was afraid the stinking tub was already homeward bound for Europe; it made no difference to my resolution not to see the beautiful Julika again. I had only to think, as I sat among the stinking barrels (I spent most of the time sitting down, because whenever I walked about in the darkness I kept stumbling over ropes and crane chains), of the letter she had sent me after her murder on the balcony, of the first sentence. 'There is not much point in returning to the conversation we had last week etc.' I only had to think of this opening sentence and I regretted nothing, not even if this tub were to run aground on a sandbank the very next moment and fill up with water. I had only to think of Foxli! Or of the famous gruel which this woman couldn't be bothered to make, and a hundred other trifles, each more ridiculous than the last; but eighteen days and nineteen nights in succession in the darkness, with water dripping through some crack between the planks&#x2014;an eternity of dripping minutes&#x2014;were not enough to summarize the waste land between this woman and me, even in the rapid shorthand of thought; again I stumbled round and grazed myself on a piece of rusty sheeting, again I squatted on a coil of rope and licked the warm blood from my hand, squatted there stinking of stale sweat and fresh sweat, seen by no one and as blind as a mole, deafened by the throb of the propeller-shaft, and not a single waking hour went by without my thinking of something against this frail woman at Davos, and nobody heard my loudest curses. But I wasn't alone.</p>

Five days passed, and naturally five nights as well, and then at last I heard my valiant stoker's whistle as agreed; but still I wasn't through with the waste land between this woman and me.</p>
<p>Now I had to go ashore. Was I alone in New York? I pushed my way through the ant-like swarm in Times Square; for weeks my eyes were continually drawn to telephone booths, but I was resolved not to ring Sibylle. And I didn't ring, but boarded a Greyhound and headed west, no matter where to. The country varied, it was tedious and entrancing, repellent, delightful. I saw the prairie, the Chicago slaughterhouses, the Mormons, the Indians, the biggest copper mine in the world, the longest suspension bridge in the world; I talked to strange faces in a milk bar; I worked for a month in Detroit; I fell in love with the daughter of a Conservative senator, who had a Cadillac, and we swam in Lake Michigan; I travelled on; I saw forest fires, baseball, sunsets over the Pacific and flying fish; I rarely had any money, but I whistled with joy at being so far from Davos, and slightly less far from Riverside Drive, New York; at this time I could have been as much alone as on the moon. They said Hallo! and I said Hallo! I listened to the last radio announcers after midnight, merely in order not to hear the silence, for in the silence I was not alone, so I preferred to listen to all those persuasive commercials telling me the best soap, the best brand of whisky, the best dog food, interspersed with symphonies or at least Tchaikovsky's <emph type="2">Nutcracker Suite</emph>&#x2014;so that I should not be so alone.</p>
<p>And if it wasn't my graceful ballerina, it was Little Grey, the graceful beast of a cat, that kept jumping on to my window sill although it had nothing to say to me. Haven't I written about that already somewhere in this heap of paper? I picked her up and shoved her into a refrigerator, then I tried to whistle and later on to sleep, but in vain; after a few hours I took her out of the refrigerator, well knowing that her death would prey on my mind; and when, after a while, she opened the slits of her eyes slightly, I was moved to tears that she hadn't inflicted her death in the refrigerator on me. I cared for her until she began to purr <!--leaf298:

'Enough!' I cried, went to the window, took her by the scruff of the neck and flung the struggling bundle as far as I could. Catlike, she fell on her feet. To my surprise, she even remained silent and did not hop up on the window sill again. She left me alone, I admit, but every moment I knew that any moment she might jump back on my window sill. So I wasn't alone.</p>
<p>Am I alone now? I'm thinking of Frau Julika Stiller-Tschudy in Paris. I see her in her black tailor-made costume, which suits her so wonderfully, and her little white hat on her red hair. It must be cold in Paris now. She had it in mind to buy a new coat. I see her (although I am not in the least acquainted with this autumn's models), in her new coat, which once again suits her splendidly. It may be that I fall in love very easily; but when I sit like this in my cell thinking of Frau Julika Stiller-Tschudy, it is more than being in love; I can feel it by my hopeless dejection; Frau Julika Stiller-Tschudy is my only hope. Quite apart now from her copper hair, her alabaster complexion, her greenish or water-grey or perhaps colourless, but anyhow exceptionally beautiful eyes&#x2014;quite apart from all this, which anyone, even my defence counsel, can see, this woman (whatever the vanished Stiller may have against her) is a superb woman, not easy to love perhaps, a woman who has never been loved and has never loved. And for this reason, I believe, I am in no way deterred by what she and Stiller went through together. What has that to do with me? I don't want to be highfalutin and declare, I love her! But I may say, I should like to love her. And so long as Frau Julika Stiller-Tschudy does not take me for her missing husband I dare to say, Why should it not be possible? On one of the next few days she will come back, <!--leaf299:

<p>I shall admit to her that it is all untrue: I am incapable of being alone, I have tried, but in vain. I shall tell her openly that I have missed her. That is no exaggeration. And then, as soon as possible, I shall ask her whether she thinks she could love me. Her smile, the astonishment in her plucked eyebrows&#x2014;I shall let none of this deter me; that's the way Frau Julika Stiller-Tschudy is. An orphan at eighteen, one quarter Hungarian, three quarters German Swiss, a tuberculosis that proved to be quite real, and then the marriage with a neurotic Spanish volunteer&#x2014;all that wasn't easy; her childlessness, her art, and the way she went through everything, not without self-pity, undoubtedly, not without a graceful kind of malice, but always with a head held high on her narrow shoulders&#x2014;that is magnificent: a touch of arrogance (in the specifically feminine manner, namely as a tendency to 'forgive') is only too understandable. My open question, whether she thinks she can love me will not be answered by any maidenly Yes. Frau Julika Stiller-Tschudy is too experienced for that, and so am I; nor is this cell with a prison bed a green snuggery under blossoming apple boughs. I hope I don't become solemn! For when I become solemn I inevitably become cowardly, if only for stylistic reasons: certain unsolemn things are then almost impossible to say. If Frau Julika Stiller-Tschudy does not answer me with an outright No, I must talk something like this:</p>
<p>'The fact is, Julika, you are my only hope, and that is the terrible thing about it. Listen to me! There is no need for us to talk about Jean-Louis Dmitritch, perhaps he loves you much more than I ever can, Dmitritch is a sensitive man, I take your word for it, a faithful half-Russian and a bit of an invalid. You haven't improved, my dear Julika; you're forever keeping an invalid. And in fact there is no chance of our improving, neither you nor I. That is the choice that remains to us, I believe: either we smash ourselves to pieces on one another, or we love one another. So, to be perfectly frank, I don't imagine it's going to be easy. In fact it will get harder year by year. Don't you agree? But there is nothing else left to us. At all costs, I think, we must start from the fact that neither of us has ever loved the other. <!--leaf300:

Out of loyalty to your husband, you say. Let us treat your husband as vanished! But you were able to part from Jean-Louis, you see, so why can't we part? Every couple, who were once happy in their own way and realized their potentialities, can get divorced; it is sad, distressing, scandalous, incomprehensible, but neither of the two suffers harm to their soul: she has two sweet children, a recompense for her innocence that is visible from afar, and he becomes deputy chairman in spite of everything: who knows which of the two will be the first to remarry? And what about us, Julika, what have we got? The memory of Foxli, to put it in a nutshell. I know the little dog isn't personally to blame for the fact that we were never happy together. But you know what I mean. We were never through with one another. And I believe that is why, in spite of everything, we couldn't part. Poor Monsieur Dmitritch! He might possess every conceivable masculine quality, in vain, they would be of no avail to him against the vacuum that binds us together. I know that, Julika, I was loved, as you know, and it was simple to love that woman, it was joy. But it didn't work out. It didn't work out because I wasn't through with you, with us. She had a child recently, by the way, I wrote and told you, and she is now once more the wife of my only friend. That's another thing. I still love her. That is why I ask you if you think you could love me; it's anything but easy for you to love me either. At times, to be quite frank, it's like trying to walk on water, and at the same time I know, we both know, that the water is rising to drown us, and will go on rising, even if we don't try to walk on it. There's not a great deal of life left to us. Everything, really everything, that is left to us in life depends upon whether we, you and I, can succeed in meeting one another above and beyond all that has happened. That sounds rather despondent, I know; but it is just the reverse, it is the hope, the certainty even, that there is still a threshold for us through which we can enter life, you into yours and I into mine, but there is only this one threshold, and neither of us can cross it alone, you see, neither you nor I&#x2014;'</p>

By the road, I mean in the last resort nothing but the hope of escaping from myself. This hope is my prison.

<p align="left">1. The Morning.</p>
<p>Around ten I was called to the public prosecutor. After eleven I was still sitting in the antechamber along with Knobel, who also had no idea what was going on. Knobel was worried that <!--leaf302:

 (g con­) page:301 (302) re:oddchar_endp (:&lt;/p&gt;) -->he might be in for a reprimand&#x2014;because of the cervelat he had slipped me, for instance&#x2014;and I was disappointed by the way the good Knobel reacted to the mere thought of a reprimand; he was afraid of losing his job. Of course he didn't say so, but felt obliged to drop the cordial tone that was usual between us as we sat in this antechamber. Knobel read a newspaper, to create an impression of independence, with an expression of ill-humour, as though churlishness provided some sort of guarantee that one was not crawling to one's superior. In Germany they click their heels, in the East they rub their hands together, in Switzerland they light a cigar and strain after a pose of surly equality as though nothing could happen in this country to a man who behaved correctly. When a smart young lady came and said, 'The public prosecutor will see you now,' Knobel made no attempt to hurry: The public prosecutor is only human, we're all taxpayers! All the same, he forgot his pince-nez. Oddly enough (on purpose?) they left the doors open; without being able to see anyone, I heard the following conversation:</p>
<p>'I wasn't going to pay a fee for that!'</p>
<p>'By the way,' said the public prosecutor, 'don't be upset by the fact that the documents of the case are full of references to a hair-oil gangster. As you've seen for yourself, the phrase is put in inverted commas. It's an expression used by our prisoner&#x2014;'</p>
<p>'So I suppose!'</p>
<p>'Everything else&#x2014;'</p>
<p>'Hair-oil gangster!' said the indignant voice. 'I shall bring an action for slander, no matter what it costs. You can tell the prisoner so today.'</p>
<p>A short pause.</p>
<p>'Just one more question, Herr Direktor&#x2014;'</p>
<p>'Certainly, Herr Staatsanwalt, anything you please.'</p>
<p>'Have you any contact with Jamaica?'</p>
<p>'How do you mean?'</p>
<p>'I'm not trying to find out about your business contacts,' said the public prosecutor. 'Don't misunderstand me, Herr Direktor. All I want to know is: when this Herr Stiller was doing the plaster head of you, did you ever talk about Jamaica?'</p>
<p>'It's possible&#x2014;'</p>
<!--leaf303:

<p>'Aha.'</p>
<p>'I have a house in Jamaica.'</p>
<p>'Aha.'</p>
<p>'Why?'</p>
<p>I heard the chair being pushed back.</p>
<p>'Once again, very many thanks, Herr Direktor,' said the public prosecutor. 'We are very relieved to see that you haven't been murdered.'</p>
<p>'Murdered?'</p>
<p>'The fact is, our prisoner maintains positively that several years ago he murdered you with his own hands.'</p>
<p>'Me?'</p>
<p>'In Jamaica&#x2014;yes.'</p>
<p>Now it was Knobel's turn, he was introduced as the warder and asked to relate everything I had told him. He was obviously unsure of himself. His story of the murder was poor, muddled, and lacking in graphic quality.</p>
<p>'In the jungle!' laughed the company director. 'Did you ever hear of such a thing, Herr Staatsanwalt? In the jungle! I've never seen a jungle in Jamaica, these are freaks of fancy, Herr Staatsanwalt, believe me&#x2014;'</p>
<p>'I believe you.'</p>
<p>'Freaks of fancy.'</p>
<p>Knobel seemed to have lost his nerve: he didn't dare describe the way the blood of the director, who was standing in front of him, mingled with the brown marsh water and how the black <emph type="2">zopilote</emph> and the well-dressed vulture waited&#x2014;just the things he should have told them now, when they asked him for more details.

<p>'Are you Herr Direktor Schmitz, then?'</p>
<p>'Answer my questions,' said the director. 'What does the prisoner claim to have murdered me with?'</p>
<p>'With an Indian dagger.'</p>
<p>'Oh.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' said Knobel, 'into the throat in front and then round to the left.'</p>
<p>'So.'</p>
<p>'Or else round to the right,' said Knobel, losing his grip again. 'I can't remember now.'</p>

<p>'Thank you.'</p>
<p>Then Knobel was told he could go. 'I'm sorry,' said Knobel; and as he went through the antechamber, cap in hand, his ears were lobster red; he didn't deign to glance at me ... I didn't hear how the director felt about this murder, because Knobel had tidily shut the door. Their conversation inside lasted another ten minutes. I was trying to read the newspaper my warder had left behind, a Social Democratic publication I should think, when suddenly the gentleman was standing in the doorway. He said: it's been a pleasure, Herr Staatsanwalt, to explain the true position to you personally. It's not a question of the money here, as I have said, I told him at the time that I was willing to pay half the agreed fee, the full half, I give you my word, but I wasn't going to be blackmailed, and if Herr Stiller wasn't satisfied he could have taken me to court, but he didn't care to, as you see. He had no money for litigationl They always say that, these psychopaths, and when I told him he could sue me for the money if he wanted to, he just called me a gangster. Now really, Herr Staatsanwalt, you wouldn't have put up with that either.'</p>
<p>The gentleman who then put on his overcoat in the antechamber was a thoroughly worthy citizen, but no more striking than any passer-by in the Bahnhofstrasse. Round his neck he wore a simple scarf of plain silk. He covered his bald head with an equally simple hat of plain felt, which when he caught sight of me, he did not raise; instead he clutched at his throat, as though adjusting the scarf. I nodded. I wonder why? He left with the words: 'We shall see one another in Court.' Then I had to go to the public prosecutor. 'There is a type of millionaire,' I said, 'you can't get at in a state where the rule of law prevails, so it's no wonder they keep on being resurrected&#x2014;'</p>
<p>The smart young lady was quickly got rid of with a job, a letter to be delivered to the Hotel Urban. I thought at once: I wonder whether Julika is back from Paris? Meanwhile the public prosecutor, whom I had hitherto only seen as a guest on my prison bed, invited me to sit down. 'Yes,' he smiled, 'my dear chap&#x2014;'</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the telephone. He turned a little to one side with the official telephone receiver, as was proper for an unofficial conversation, listened with his hand on his bunch of keys and gazing out of the window, for his part said only that he would not be home for lunch, an on-the-spot investigation he had in the afternoon, and rang off abruptly, obviously bothered by a question he didn't want to have to answer in my presence. Then he turned to me again, not without a trace of embarrassment.</p>
<p>'Sibylle sends her good wishes.'</p>
<p>'Thank you,' I said. 'How is she?'</p>
<p>'Thank you, he said, 'she's glad to be home again.'</p>
<p>Then&#x2014;after the last smile had vanished from his face and a silence of unconcealed embarrassment had lasted long enough, a silence that seemed to imply it was now settled that I was the missing Stiller and therefore the former lover of his wife, who was now glad to be back home, and after he had put away his bunch of keys&#x2014;he uttered his not very original remark:</p>
<p>'Life's a funny thing.'</p>
<p>I couldn't think of anything either.</p>
<p>'If it's all right with you, Stiller, let us have lunch together. We've got until two o'clock&#x2014;I suggest,' he said as he stood up, 'that we drive a little way out into the country.'</p>

<p align="left">2. Lunch.</p>
<p>A rather taciturn drive through fields and woods. Everything very autumnal. The sun was still just hot enough to sit out of doors, at least round midday. We sat in a rather quaint open-air restaurant which nevertheless had a wide and delightful view; above our heads there were vine leaves and in front of us a few straggling vines between which we looked out on the lake sparkling under a hazy light; everything was as though beneath a veil of blue smoke, including the brown ploughed fields and the woods with their dying leaves glowing. Here and there ladders still leaned against the trees and baskets stood down below. Wasps even came at our campari. The mountains towering up above the autumnal haze were as clear as glass and somehow unreal; their snow gleamed dazzling white from behind <!--leaf306:

<p>The food was excellent.</p>
<p>'What shall we drink?' asked my prosecutor and friend. 'They have a very good Maienfelder here, I believe.'</p>
<p>'That'll do fine,' I said, 'fine.'</p>
<p>I couldn't help looking again and again at the landscape, which fell away to the lake in a magnificently broad sweep. The autumn mist blotted out the pettiness of the housing development, which was neither town nor village; there remained the hills covered with trees, the gentle hollows filled with ploughed fields and bogs, a landscape that preoccupied me precisely because it did not in the least surprise me. I knew it. Did I love it?</p>
<p>'I've heard,' said my public prosecutor, 'that our friends were rather disappointed the other day. They found you cold.'</p>
<p>'Perhaps I am.'</p>
<p>'Why?'</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders. I felt about them as I did about this landscape, which in fact, like almost every landscape, is worthy of affection. It must be my fault ... Once more everything was there, the wasps in the bottle, the shadows on the gravel, the golden stillness of transience, everything as though spellbound, the cackling hens in the meadow, the brown and over-ripe pears littering the roadway, the asters leaning over an iron railing, their centres bloody stars that ran towards the edges, the bluish light under the trees. It was as though everything were bidding itself good-bye; the whispering foliage of a poplar, the metallic bloom on the fallen fruit, the smoke rising from the fields where they were burning weeds, the lake glittering behind a grille of vines. Soon the sun would be turning rusty in the haze of mid afternoon, the time of walking home without an overcoat, hands in trouser pockets, the damp leaves that no longer rusde, the farmsteads with their wine presses, the dripping barrels in the dusk, the red lanterns of a lakeside landing-place in the mist...</p>

A strange reunion after years apart! Young as they are, they are talking about the ages of man, and they already know that at every age, apart from childhood, time is rather horrifying; and yet every age is beautiful the less we deny or dream away what belongs to it, for death itself, which will one day be our lot, cannot be denied, or dreamed away, or postponed. How much the young man talks about the two conditions of his life, work and expiation, as he calls it; and work&#x2014;that is the joy, the fever, the excitement, so that you cannot sleep for jubilation, a cry that rings out across hours and days, so that you feel like running away from yourself&#x2014;that is work, the elation that wins people without wishing to, that puts no one under an obligation, ties no one and advances no one, that is not calculating and avaricious, but behaves like the angel who has no hands for taking; work is a grandiose fervour of the heart in which all human contacts are purely incidental, an extra, a cheerful squandering from excess of joy; later, of course, it always turns out to be the finest sort of contact that is possible between human beings, unattainable as soon as it becomes a goal, a need, an urgent objective. Again and again there comes this sudden outbreak of depression that does not develop because people stay away, on the contrary&#x2014;people only stay away because depression is about to break out, they can scent weeks ahead, as a dog can scent an earthquake, that everything which has been built up will once more be reduced to rubble and smothered in ashes, smothered in melancholy like a flock of black birds flapping their wings over the scenes of past joy, the shadow of fear&#x2014;that is the expiation, the after-pangs of doubt, the horror of uncreative solitude.</p>

<p>How the young man likes talking, and how beautiful the young woman finds it, nevertheless! The silver-edged clouds melt before the sun and little woods rise like islands out of a metallic glitter; they wander through a reedy marsh and as she jumps across a murmuring rill her shoe sticks in the clinging morass; the young woman balances like a tight-rope walker with one stockinged foot in the air, so that the young man has to hold her. They kiss for the first time. Behind the copses there are lakes of coolness with snow still lying in the shady patches between the red-barked willows. As they are leaving a wood they stand still, arm in arm; the lake lies before them again like a flashing scythe, and over the Alps froth the silent breakers of the clouds, a mass of luminous foam.</p>
<p>They stop at some peasant inn. A child with plaits serves them. Behind a row of low windows full of shoots and a tangle of plants and sun slanting into the stillness of the wooden room and gleaming on their waiting plates, they feel how far they have roamed; they enjoy the well-earned meal&#x2014;bacon with bread, peasant bread, that breaks up into moist and delicious hunks. A fly is buzzing against the window pane. The moment is enveloped and borne aloft by the clouds of a happiness that is close to sorrow, a strange, an alert sense of existence, an unexpected community of sentiment, that was lying in wait for them in this workaday peasant room, the knowledge that they have met one another. No question is yet raised as to what will come of it; there prevails only the complete sense of how much is possible in a lifetime...</p>
<p>That is spring here, and in summer the hens cackle under the wooden tables, the vine leaves overhead are green and dense, the sky whitish, the lake like dull lead, bees hum round the edge of the wood, the blue haze above the motionless stalks in the tall meadows is alive with darting butterflies, the mountains are lost in the glare of the sun, and now (almost before I have emptied my glass) it is already autumn again and once more all this: baskets full of leaves, the dampness of mist and suddenly it is midday, a midday as at this moment, with gold in the air and time passing like an invisible gesture over the hillsides and apples falling with a thud. If you walk through the woods now there is a smell of mushrooms. Here it smells of new wine. Wasps <!--leaf309:

Who notices the passing of the years and all that happens? All things are one, space filled with existence, nothing comes back to us, everything is repeated, the span of our existence is but an instant and the day comes when we no longer count the autumns, all living things are like the stillness over the ripening slopes, the grapes of parting hang on the vines of our lives. Pass on! Once more on days like these the lake beckons; your skin tingles if you swim now, you feel the warmth of your own blood, you swim as though in glass, you swim above the shadowy deeps of cold, and the glittering waves splinter on the shore; far out a sail sweeps along in front of silvery clouds, a moth on a sparkling web, canvas steeped in the shimmering rays of the sun against a background of faint and hazy shores. There are moments when time seems to be standing still, dizzy with happiness; God gazes upon himself and the whole world holds its breath, before it crumbles into the ashes of twilight...</p>
<p>At one point my public prosecutor said to me:</p>
<p>'That's Herrliberg down there, you know, and that place you can see in the distance is Thalwil.'</p>
<p>Then the peasant girl took our plates away and asked if we had enjoyed the meal, and after she had brought the box of cigars we were once more alone. Of course, I had felt long ago that my prosecutor and friend had something on his mind. Had I prevented him from coming out with it? When our cigars were alight, the moment had arrived. Our glasses were empty, the black coffee hadn't been brought yet, the wasps had disappeared and in some little country church a clock struck.</p>

Sibylle wants to spare you any unnecessary suffering, and I think she's right: the court will not understand you at all, Stiller. The court will quite simply treat you as a convicted swindler, a figure of fun; the court is used to swindles, as you may imagine, but only to swindles that bring some advantage, a fortune or a title or the like, in short you will be condemned to some punishment.

 (informed the Herr Staatsanwalt that this was not the top; opened a partition and invited us to mount a narrow and sud­denly very steep staircase of deal. They kept me in the middle all the time, either by chance or design. The taciturn gravity of the whole proceedings, especially on the part of Knobel, who had cut me dead since the morning, was funny; but even my friend and prosecutor was mute in a way that suggested we were approaching the scene of a tragedy with an unknown number of corpses. 'Yes - ' he said, when we reached the top, once more half to me and half to Knobel, i hope the others will soon be here...' There were three doors here, the first was fitted with a pad­lock, the second bore a humorous sign indicating a lavatory, the third led into the missing man's studio. Knobel unlocked the door; as an official on duty he went in first, while the public prosecutor said to me, 'After you.' To avoid giving the impres­sion that I felt in any way at home here, I took advantage of his politeness, and I also noticed that at this moment Rolf, my friend, was feeling far more uncomfortable than I, more edgy than I had ever known him. No sooner were we inside the studio than he asked me: 'Where's the wardrobe?' Knobel pointed to a nail on the blue door. 'Yes,' said the public prosecutor, immediately rubbing his hands together, ' - open a window, Knobel, the air in here is ghastly.' I felt sorry for my friend; as I knew, this studio had once assumed a certain importance in his own life, a disproportionate importance, as he now very well knew; but that is the infamy of these outside hearings - they are intended to overwhelm the prisoner with long-buried memories by suddenly placing him in a familiar environment. Fortunately I didn't have time to utter any well-meant remark, for at that very moment the bell rang, and we were both glad of it. Knobel looked for the press-button that opened the door downstairs and found it.

They kept me in the middle all the time, either by chance or design. The taciturn gravity of the whole proceedings, especially on the part of Knobel, who had cut me dead since the morning, was funny; but even my friend and prosecutor was mute in a way that suggested we were approaching the scene of a tragedy with an unknown number of corpses.</p>
<p>'Yes&#x2014;' he said, when we reached the top, once more half to me and half to Knobel, 'I hope the others will soon be here...'</p>
<p>There were three doors here, the first was fitted with a padlock, the second bore a humorous sign indicating a lavatory, the third led into the missing man's studio. Knobel unlocked the door; as an official on duty he went in first, while the public prosecutor said to me, 'After you.' To avoid giving the impression that I felt in any way at home here, I took advantage of his politeness, and I also noticed that at this moment Rolf, my friend, was feeling far more uncomfortable than I, more edgy than I had ever known him. No sooner were we inside the studio than he asked me:</p>
<p>'Where's the wardrobe?'</p>
<p>Knobel pointed to a nail on the blue door.</p>
<p>'Yes,' said the public prosecutor, immediately rubbing his hands together, '&#x2014;open a window, Knobel, the air in here is ghastly.'</p>
<p>I felt sorry for my friend; as I knew, this studio had once assumed a certain importance in his own life, a disproportionate importance, as he now very well knew; but that is the infamy of these outside hearings&#x2014;they are intended to overwhelm the prisoner with long-buried memories by suddenly placing him in a familiar environment. Fortunately I didn't have time to utter any well-meant remark, for at that very moment the bell rang, and we were both glad of it. Knobel looked for the press-button that opened the door downstairs and found it. I still didn't know who was actually attending this idiotic investigation, presumably my counsel, possibly also Julika, I thought, and I didn't even take my coat off: I had no intention of making <!--leaf314:

The public prosecutor exclaimed: 'Why don't you press it?' i am pressing,' said Knobel, T am pressing.' Meanwhile I took a look around, my hands in my trouser pockets under my open coat and my hat on my head - after all it wasn't a dwelling in which anyone dwelt. There was a lot of art standing about. Apart from the thick dust on every sill, every spatula, every easel, every stand, every piece of furniture - so that for this reason alone one felt unwilling to touch any­thing - it was just such a studio as I had imagined from Frau Sibylle's descriptions, rather topsy-turvy, like a workshop that was lived in, half proletarian, half romantic; a stovepipe running right across the room demonstrated with an inescapable gesture that convention had no place here, and yet it was precisely the stovepipe you find in every Paris studio, the conventional sym­bol of a certain bohemianism. I should worry! For the rest, it was a large, and to that extent agreeable room, a kind of garret with rough deal planks that creaked softly when we walked on them, and plenty of light on a sunny autumn day like today. Below a sloping roof exactly as Frau Sibylle had remembered it, stood an old gas cooker, its enamel scarred with rust, a terrazzo sink and a crooked cupboard containing crockery, on the top shelf of which - obviously intended as a joke - was displayed stolen crockery bearing various inscriptions: Hotel des Alpes, Bodega Granada, Kronenhalle Zurich, and so on. The rubber tube on the tap, once no doubt red, now a grey and mildewed rubber dummy, was still attached with string; it was dripping and I wondered whether it had been dripping like that for six years, a passing idea that somehow irritated me, remind­ing me of the dripping in the Carlsbad caves. On a nail hung a dishcloth spotted with blackish mould like a leper, and naturally enough there was no lack of spider's webs, for example on the telephone, which stood next to the couch and presumably no longer rang, having fallen silent under the burden of unpaid bills. The couch was broad, big enough for two, also covered in dust, so that nobody sat on it, which gave this piece of furniture an obtrusive importance, as though it were standing in a 3«3 )

He had no eye for the splendid view over gables and skylights and chimneys and party walls, a view that even contained a wedge of the lake that glittered under the hazy autumn light when a steamboat set its lazy waves in motion - a really delightful view, it seemed to me. He was smoking rather nervously. Why did we have to come to this place where there were so many things to cause him pain, irrelevant details that were not meant like that at all and never­theless assumed for him, Sibylle's husband, a distressing signifi­cance, whether it was this mattress that was just being beaten in front of our eyes, or the elastic garters the hawker had offered him, the best quality pine-needle oil for the bath, or the hair slides that are forever getting lost and are always wanted again; why, I mean, did we have to look at this place which his wife and he had inwardly overcome long ago? I could see from his lips that it was costing him more than he had anticipated, and to no purpose. I don't know what he was thinking about during those two or three minutes during which he smoked his cigarette down to the tip; but it was futile, no doubt about it, there are tests which are completely off the mark, like this one. The rotten frame of an armchair, on which his wife may never have sat, because the fabric was already missing seven years ago, was all at once sufficient to cast fresh doubt on their love after years of certainty, to appear to show in one minute that they had made no progress in six or seven years, and to conjure up mental )

I was well aware how Rolf, my new friend, must be noticing all these irrelevant details. He had no eye for the splendid view over gables and skylights and chimneys and party walls, a view that even contained a wedge of the lake that glittered under the hazy autumn light when a steamboat set its lazy waves in motion ~ a really delightful view, it seemed to me. He was smoking rather nervously. Why did we have to come to this place where there were so many things to cause him pain, irrelevant details that were not meant like that at all and nevertheless assumed for him, Sibylle's husband, a distressing significance, whether it was this mattress that was just being beaten in front of our eyes, or the elastic garters the hawker had offered him, the best quality pine-needle oil for the bath, or the hair slides that are forever getting lost and are always wanted again; why, I mean, did we have to look at this place which his wife and he had inwardly overcome long ago? I could see from his lips that it was costing him more than he had anticipated, and to no purpose. I don't know what he was thinking about during those two or three minutes during which he smoked his cigarette down to the tip; but it was futile, no doubt about it, there are tests which are completely off the mark, like this one. The rotten frame of an armchair, on which his wife may never have sat, because the fabric was already missing seven years ago, was all at once sufficient to cast fresh doubt on their love after years of certainty, to appear to show in one minute that they had made no progress in six or seven years, and to conjure up mental <!--leaf320:

 (images of agonizing precision, images of the past, which in any case, whether accurate or inaccurate, could only leave a bad taste in the mouth. Or did my friend expect of himself that he should be able to bear these torments, which only the inert physical surroundings reawakened in him, without distress? It was futile. What had all this stufThere, even if it were not rotten, to do with his living Sibylle, with his relationship to her? There is a disgust that can never come to an end, a disgust that is the inevitable punishment for harbouring mental images that have nothing to do with us - or so I believe. Why did he inflict this on himself? It is possible to overcome jealousy, to overcome it from within and in relation to one's partner, to overcome it as a whole, as he had succeeded in doing; but it is nonsense to imagine that one must also be able to swallow the individual fragments without turning a hair. His smile was rather strained. Didn't he know, my friend and prosecutor, who had accom­panied so many people to the scene of the crime, didn't he know that there is often something diabolical about inert objects? Naturally, I didn't know what to say to him on this parapet. It was such an unnecessary humiliation, and for the first time I realized what false reactions can be evoked by an on-the-spot investigation, when a person is confronted with inert objects, as if there existed a truth outside time ... As he said nothing, I asked rather abruptly: 'How old is your wife now, by the way?' 'Sibylle-?' 'Hannes must be nearly ready to go to grammar school,' I went on chattily, 'and now this little one, that must be wonderful for your wife, and a girl too - !' 'Yes,' he said, 'it's wonderful.'

<p>During this speech we stood arm in arm again, either because Julika was afraid I might take advantage of the now unlocked door, or because she clung to me out of genuine affection; I could feel the warmth of her body.</p>
<p>My counsel was still speaking: So chin up, there's no place like home, an occasional trip abroad of course, so that we learn to appreciate our homeland afresh, but man needs roots and so no doubt does the artist in me, roots, that's the important thing, roots and again roots, millions homeless, so I should be thankful, mustn't always look on the black side, a little love for mankind, the Swiss are only human too, nobody can change his skin, a more positive attitude called for on my part, more composure, no smashing things up like just now, all due deference to self-criticism, but one shouldn't make a filthy mess of dust and fragments, all due deference to temperament, but moderation in all things, things weren't as bad as I thought, and Z&#xFC;rich was just about the finest city in the world, but as he'd said, a more positive attitude was essential, enough nihilism in the world today, every individual must do his bit to improve the world, if everyone wholeheartedly desired the good, things would be all right, like Frau Julika for example, Frau Julika was a model in every way, all respect for Frau Julika, nothing could divert her from womanly fidelity to me, a rare woman, but a typical woman, a wonderful woman, men often stubborn and egoistic, women so different, motherly, difficult in her way, certainly, but only because I didn't understand her, her wealth of emotion, Julika's inner life so much richer than most other women's, heart in the right place, a little more feeling on my part, the eternal feminine draws us upward, enough intellectualism in the world today, mustn't always think and doubt, but hope, chin up and hope, no marriage without hope, without hope no peace between individuals and peoples, anyone can see that, without hope no true art as in the Middle Ages, in short, without hope no hope, so hand on heart and no silly fuss, Stiller, too, good at heart, my counsel convinced of his good heart, everything else dust in the balance, the name for example, but we must have order, everyone has to bear a name, my counsel no bureaucrat, naturally, my counsel positively shattered by his glimpse into this marriage of two estimable people, my counsel <!--leaf327:

More like a craving for pain. The feeling of being called and possessing no voice myself. Later, when I was already in the city hospital, I am supposed to have said something like this and to have begged for sleep. Looking back on it I think the terrible pain consisted in suddenly being unable to do anything more, unable to move either backwards or forwards, not being able to fall, no longer having any above or below and yet being still there, motionless without end, without death. Just as one knows in dreams that it is a dream, so I knew that this was not death, even if I now died. Put prosaically, I felt tremendously per­plexed, rather as though I had jumped off a high wall in order to dash myself in pieces, but the ground didn't come, it never came, there was nothing but falling, a falling that was actually no falling, a state of total powerlessness accompanied by total wakefulness, only time had disappeared, as I said, time as the medium within which we normally act; everything stayed as it was, nothing passed away, everything remained like that once and for all. As I was told later, I was given injections at short intervals.

<p>Of the dreams that came to me in a never-ending stream during that period I remember little, since I could not tell them to anyone. (Once Florence, the mulatto girl, paid me a visit in the city hospital; I understood her very well, although I couldn't utter more than a word or two.) One of the dreams went like this:</p>
<p>Just as I am strangling Little Grey I realize that it is not the cat, but Julika, who is laughing in a way I have never known her to laugh, Julika is altogether quite different, gay, I strangle the cat with all my strength, Julika mocks me in front of an audience that is invisible to me, the cat doesn't defend itself, but afterwards jumps up on the window sill and licks itself, Julika was never my wife, it was all just my imagination...</p>
<p>Another dream:</p>
<p>Mother is lying in my bed, ghastly although smiling, a wax doll, hair like brush bristles, I am filled with horror, I try to switch on the electric light but can't, I try to ring Julika but can't, everything has been cut off, darkness through the whole house and yet I can see my wax mother perfectly clearly, utterly horrified I fall to my knees with a cry in order to wake up, suddenly I am holding in my hands an Easter egg as big as a head...</p>
<p>Other dreams I can remember even less clearly. They all seemed to be about the same thing, and they continued while I was in a coma, for instance...</p>

We give little thought to people whose life we cannot visualize, even if we imagine they may need us. I neglected them completely; my wife, for her part, had different reasons for feeling she couldn't write, worthier reasons.

 ( in lengthy descriptions. Anyhow, he seemed to be thoroughly happy. We had to imagine a capacious house, originally a Vaudois farm-house, perhaps even a wine­grower's house, Stiller wasn't sure about that; attached to it were a vineyard, a wine-press of venerable age, an airy barn that made an ample studio, and an avenue of plane-trees that gave the whole estate a manorial touch. In other letters they were not planes, but elms. In subsequent letters the barn van­ished altogether. Instead other joys made their appearance: Stiller suddenly wrote about the old well in the courtyard, whose wrought ironwork he drew for us, about the beehive or the rose garden. He described all this with affectionate good-humour as rather overgrown, rather rusty, rather dried up, and everything was smothered in dark ivy. At times our imagination was severely strained, especially as we knew the district round Glion. We could only suppose that our happy friend was exag­gerating a bit. Sketches by his hand showed a steep tiled roof with ends as well as sides inclined, as is usual in the Vaud, a broad terrace with fruit trees all round and in the background the mountains of Savoy; the avenue with the eighty elms was missing. My wife took the liberty of inquiring about this.

We give little thought to people whose life we cannot visualize, even if we imagine they may need us. I neglected them completely; my wife, for her part, had different reasons for feeling she couldn't write, worthier reasons.</p>
<p>After about half a year, in the late summer, came the elated letter in which Stiller announced: 'As a reward from God for all the months I spent in the remand prison, we have just found, rented, and moved into the house of our dreams, <emph type="2">une ferme vaudoise!'</emph> We breathed a sigh of relief. It really seemed to be a godsend. A fabulously low rent suggested an equally fabulous state of dilapidation, but our friend did not tire of singing the praises of his <emph type="2">ferme vaudoise</emph> in lengthy descriptions. Anyhow, he seemed to be thoroughly happy. We had to imagine a capacious house, originally a Vaudois farm-house, perhaps even a winegrower's house, Stiller wasn't sure about that; attached to it were a vineyard, a wine-press of venerable age, an airy barn that made an ample studio, and an avenue of plane-trees that gave the whole estate a manorial touch. In other letters they were not planes, but elms. In subsequent letters the barn vanished altogether. Instead other joys made their appearance: Stiller suddenly wrote about the old well in the courtyard, whose wrought ironwork he drew for us, about the beehive or the rose garden. He described all this with affectionate good-humour as rather overgrown, rather rusty, rather dried up, and everything was smothered in dark ivy. At times our imagination was severely strained, especially as we knew the district round Glion. We could only suppose that our happy friend was exaggerating a bit. Sketches by his hand showed a steep tiled roof with ends as well as sides inclined, as is usual in the Vaud, a broad terrace with fruit trees all round and in the background the mountains of Savoy; the avenue with the eighty elms was missing. My wife took the liberty of inquiring about this. A special sketch&#x2014;as a sketch so charming that we hung it up in a passepartout&#x2014;showed the interior with a great farmhouse chimney and Frau Julika kneeling in front of it making up the fire; on the edge of the sheet was a cordial invitation to a <emph type="2">raclette.</emph></p>

<p>Winter came and we did not see Stiller. He hadn't the money to come to Zurich, and no desire, even if we had invited him. Spring also went by without a meeting. Today this surprises me. Stiller wrote to us quite often; Frau Julika appeared in his letters fairly frequently. We knew that she had worked for a time as shop assistant in a grocery. But on the important point, their married life together, his letters gave not the slightest hint. Instead he devoted two or three pages to descriptions of sunsets. Fundamentally he said nothing at all; to me it was always as though his letters had reached me in a bottle carried by the waves from some distant outpost, and I had no right to break his silence as in a legal interrogation, either by a direct or leading question or by putting a provocative misconstruction on what he had said. He did his best to write in a humorous vein.</p> 
<p> suppose you don't believe that I have found the house of my dreams,' he wrote again. 'Why don't you come? I admit we see Chillon Castle and the Dents du Midi, and that when the west wind is blowing you can hear the State Railway, loudspeakers from an international regatta, and the jingle-jangle of dance orchestras playing for the visitors to our spa, and I don't deny that you can see from here a few Montreux hotels, the whole lot in fact, but we are simply above them, inwardly above them as well, you know.

<p>When we received letters like this we always recalled with a smile Stiller's former jeers at country life as 'sentimental escapism'; now he seemed to be feeling better in his <emph type="2">feme vaudoise</emph> than ever before. We were particularly relieved to hear that Frau Stiller had found a satisfactory part-time job: she was teaching eurhythmies in a Montreux girls' school. And Stiller himself had started working. On my wife's birthday she received a whole consignment of pottery&#x2014;bowls and jugs and plates, most useful things. Stiller had never breathed a word about this. Now he wrote in connexion with his present:</p>
<p>'Here in Glion, you must know, in case you ever come, I've been a potter from birth. I'm making a lot of money now. And once I've got my own kiln things will really start humming. And when I'm tired of making money I shall go up to Caux, which is quite near here, ten minutes on the little railway. But I haven't reached that point yet; I'm not doing my own firing yet.

<p>Stiller never lost his delight in mischievous pranks. He needed a certain measure of disguise in order to feel at ease with people. After my wife had visited Stiller in Glion on her way to the South of France with the children, I asked her about his <emph type="2">ferme vaudoise</emph>; she merely laughed loudly. I must see it for myselfl In reality things were probably not so fabulous as in his letters. Frau Stiller had once more to go 'intp the mountains'. It was during this period of solitude that he kept ringing me up in the evening. His calls were often a nuisance, coming just when we had company. As a rule Stiller had been drinking; he began talking about Kierkegaard and pretended to be in urgent need of elucidation from me. He made these calls from a tavern&#x2014;his own telephone had been cut off because he hadn't paid the bill. I was never an expert on Kierkegaard; I sent him the book following a conversation about melancholy as a symptom of the aesthetic attitude to life. When he rang me I hadn't got the book handy, and nor had Stiller. Above all, it was obvious that he had scarcely read Kierkegaard yet, so there must have been something else on his mind. He used to hang on for a quarter of an hour or more, halfan hour sometimes, probably just to listen to a voice. In the background I could hear sounds from the tavern, the clink of glasses being rinsed, the clank of a pin-table. I could scarcely make out what he was saying. He must often have thought me a miserly skinflint and cursed me in his heart. I knew his economic position and tried to bring these expensive conversations to an end. I probably wasn't sufficiently capable of putting myself in his place. His jokes did not deceive me as to the degree of his loneliness, his longing for a friend. It was precisely because I was so clearly aware of this that I felt so helpless. All too often I simply couldn't provide what he expected, for I hadn't got it, and consequently he was doing me an injustice with his sudden question: 'Are you mean?' Then he would continue: 'Say something for heaven's sake, I don't care what, but say something!' And he regularly concluded with the <!--leaf347:

Then we set off. In fact, and almost to my surprise, there was a <emph type="2">vieux sentitr</emph> to Glion. Stony and steep, as described, it led upwards between vine-clad walls. As we advanced we began to feel our age; rather out of breath we stood still and looked at Chillon Castle, below us Territet with its hotels, tennis courts, funicular railways, and chalets, but beyond it the great blue Lake Geneva. It was almost like being by the Mediterranean. Once you can forget the shoddy-looking chalets, this landscape <!--leaf348:

Whereabouts on this vandalized hillside a <emph type="2">ferme vaudoise</emph> could possibly be concealed was a puzzle to me. And we must be almost at Glion. Our conversation dealt with wine-growing, then with the concept of culture, of leisure as a prerequisite for culture and with the nobility of enjoyment, with the fundamental difference between potatoes and vines, the spiritual serenity of all districts devoted to viticulture, the connexion between luxury and human dignity and so forth&#x2014;I did not fail to see the little sign on the iron garden gate bearing the inscription 'Swiss Pottery' in English. Stiller pushed the rusty little gate open with his foot, and without interrupting the conversation led me along a moss-grown path, past all sorts of garden gnomes, to his dream-house.</p>
<p>One glance at the universal dilapidation showed why the rent was so low. Vases of cast iron liberally decorated with arabesques, some of them damaged, a sandstone Aphrodite or Artemis with a broken arm, a little jungle that was doubtless supposed to be the rose garden, lots ofsteps everywhere, crooked, flanked on both sides by banisters, some of them crumbling away, revealing that they were all only cement, a moss-grown fountain, an old kennel, weed-grown terraces&#x2014;this must have been the garden, populated by a considerable number of jolly garden gnomes of brightly painted pottery, some broken, some undamaged. I still thought this was no more than the path leading to his own estate. Stiller talked and talked, unperturbed by the nauseating surroundings, with which he was familiar. The house itself, a chalet, was fortunately smothered by ivy, only the upper part emerged in all its fake antiquity&#x2014;a brickbuilt turret with cute little loopholes. In addition there was a wooden fa&#xE7;ade covered in scroll-work that looked as though it had been made with a fretsaw, and elsewhere blocks of tufa. Everything was united under a roof with enormous eaves. And the whole place was not large, but tiny, like a toy; I couldn't believe my eyes. It was a Swiss chalet distantly related to a Scottish castle.</p>
<p>Stiller now pulled the two bottles out of his jacket pockets, hauled a key from his trousers, and announced that Frau Julika would be back from her girls' school in about an hour.</p>
<p>So there we were. As on so many chalets of this kind, there <!--leaf349:

And with that the joke was over. I asked, 'How are you?' and received the impression that Stiller had made up his mind not to complain. 'How's your wife?' he asked back. In subsequent conversations, too, he avoided uttering her name; I don't know why. Apart from this he did not inquire after anyone, and conversation was really a great effort.</p>
<p>'Why don't you put these garden gnomes in the tool-shed?' I asked, for the sake of something to say. Stiller shrugged his shoulders: 'I haven't got time, I don't know, they don't bother me.' But in spite of everything I felt he was glad of the visit. 'When Julika comes,' he said, 'we'll drink our wine.' Meanwhile we smoked...</p>
<p>I remember that insignificant quarter of an hour very well. What does man do with the days of his life? I was scarcely aware of the question, it just irritated me. How could Stiller bear to face this question unprotected by affairs of social or professional importance, without any defences? He sat on the weather-worn balustrade, one knee drawn up and his hands clasped round it; when I looked at him I could not imagine how he could bear this existence, how any man can bear his existence once he has <!--leaf350:

<p>His pottery was situated in an underground chamber with a good light cut into the side of the hill lower down&#x2014;once a wash-house with' a drying room and a storehouse for garden furniture, formerly whitewashed, but now papered with grey mould although the sun shone in from midday till dusk. I was relieved: here I found it easier to imagine my friend's days. 'One has to do something,' he commented as we looked at his finished wares, the 'Swiss pottery' with which he earned his meagre livelihood. 'Julika still likes these shallow bowls best,' he said. Another time: 'Everything has to be learnt, you know, and I shall never become a proper potter now.' Stiller took particular pleasure in displaying a potter's wheel he had made himself. As a layman, I considered him a master of his craft when he talked about the pottery of various peoples and periods, about the mystery of certain glazes. In what way had he changed? It seemed to me that his mind was directed more towards things themselves than it had been. Once he had spoken only of himself when he talked about marriage in general, about Negroes, volcanoes, and heaven knows what else: now he talked about 'his' pots, 'his' wheel, 'his' glaze, even 'his' skill, without speaking of himself at all.</p>
<p>'Herr Staatsanwalt!' Frau Julika greeted me. And Stiller gave her a kiss on the check; his hands were rather dirty from the potter's wheel. I found Frau Julika noticeably older, an unusually beautiful woman still, her striking girlish hair with its almost natural sheen stranger than ever. 'He never misses a good excuse to drink wine!' she remarked when Stiller went to fetch his bottles, having first put the two wobbly arm-chairs out in the garden for us. it's nice here,' said Frau Julika, 'isn't it?' In spite of the growing sympathy I felt for this unusual woman, I never quite knew what to talk to her about. It would be wrong to take her cool manner, which was probably only a mask to cover her shyness, personally. In all likelihood she had no inkling how little she communicated herself, and couldn't understand it when people failed to notice her goodwill, her delight at seeing someone or in a little present. She looked at the little hand-printed cloth. 'You can't get anything like that round <!--leaf351: 
type:bold
 (here,' was all she said. I think she had a profound aversion to expressing herself in words, but on the other hand the way Frau Julika immediately put the little cloth aside, although she prob­ably liked it, made me feel throughly embarrassed too, as though I had been expecting a speech of thanks. Now I inquired about her job at the girls' school down in the valley but learnt practi­cally nothing and had to think what else might interest her. She had cushioned her head on her coppery hair, understandably tired after her day's work. 'Our Stiller has become a real potter!' I began, and she nodded. Earlier on, in the underground chamber, I had been struck by Stiller's remark: Julika still likes these shallow bowls best. This suggested a limited appreciation on his wife's part, a lack of interest or even scepticism regarding his endeavours, yes, the good Stiller seemed to miss something, something like en­couragement, criticism within the framework of enthusiasm; down in the underground chamber one got the impression that Frau Julika really regarded his whole activity as a potter as humbug. Now she said to me: 'Don't you think it's amazing what he's done in these two years?' I did think so. 'You should tell him that,' I remarked. 'He'd like to hear it.' - 'Don't I tell him?' - 'You know what we men are like,' I said evasively. 'We like to make an impression on the woman we love, and if we can't manage that we try the public' I meant it more as a joke, i don't know,' said Frau Julika, rubbing her eyes with both hands, 'what he expects of me. Haven't I told him? Can I help it if he doesn't listen?' I had no intention of interposing myself in the role of guardian, so I broke off the conversation. 'You're very formal with one another,' burst in Stiller, mak­ing our embarrassment complete. 'Well, proW/!' he said to bridge the gap, and Stiller and I went to work on the cool little glasses.

'Aren't you drinking?' he inquired when Julika did not pick up the glass he had filled for her, because she didn't feel like it. He repeated, 'Well, <emph type="2">prosit!'</emph> For a moment I really wondered whether Julika might not be expecting a child; her refusal to drink wine was as mute as it was definite, as though she wasn't allowed to, and I thought it a pity she didn't at least take a sip. In some way she shut herself out from the start. There is nothing trickier, I find again and again, than a three-cornered gathering. <!--leaf352: 
type:ent
 (dapta­) page:351 (352) -->I made a great effort not to be drawn into an alliance with Stiller. It was easy with him, he has a feminine gift of adaptability, and for her part Frau Julika did nothing to prevent herself from being shut out. She lay back among her long hair without a word; her face, which I saw in profile, entranced and disturbed me in equal measure, it seemed to wear an expression of mute terror that had become permanent. Stiller paid no heed to this, but let himself go in witty persiflage, frequently directing his remarks to Frau Julika with an undertone of tender entreaty, half consideration and half coercion. Several times I thought: He makes it too easy for himself, he pays with charm, of which he has plenty, that doesn't cost him anything. It also seemed to me that Stiller was perpetually trying to make amends for something; on such occasions he became polite to the point of timidity.</p>
<p>'Take it away,' said Frau Julika. 'I don't need a cushion, really I don't.' Stiller felt rejected, to judge by his brief glance at Julika, unjustly rejected. If I had been asked to act as arbiter, I should have had to take Frau Julika's part as regards the superfluousness of the proferred cushion. 'Where are you going to set up your kiln?' I asked, to change the subject; but Stiller didn't hear. 'Why don't you want this cushion?' he insisted, until poor Frau Julika finally took it for the sake of peace, without thanking him, and instead of putting it behind her head pushed it under her knees, where it was less in the way. Two well-meaning people! I thought and praised the delicious wine.</p>
<p>For no particular reason I recalled the little story someone had told me recently. 'You once discovered Mexico,' I said, 'this will interest you. Some chap was breeding pigs there, I don't know where exactly, anyhow it didn't pay, he sweated his guts out, but to no avail, and he had invested all his means and half his life in it, and all his ambition; to cut a long story short, the business simply didn't pay, and then on top of everything else there came a devastating drought. That happens, doesn't it? The river dried up, I don't know which one; and then apparently things got so bad that the crocodiles migrated over land to the nearest water. One fine day a convoy of these crocodiles started heading straight across his pig farm. What was he to do? The unfortunate fellow could have climbed up on <!--leaf353:

Her laugh was completely forced, and as a matter of fact, when I look back, I can't remember this woman ever laughing in any other way. Her laughter always stayed on her face; it was as though she had no inward laughter, as though she had lost it. It was quite useless trying to cheer Frau Julika up; afterwards one felt utterly silly. Now I was annoyed at myself. What was the point of all this talk? It was a late afternoon in autumn with a gentle sun, the hour Stiller had described in his letter: ' - and then, my dear sir, when we sit outside and the autumn sun is enough to make you happy, when there are grapes again, when a metallic haze hangs over the lake, but the mountain-tops are clear and bright with golden woods against a Mediterranean sky and the light lies across the lake in a pathway of pure quicksilver, later of gleaming brass, then of copper - ' The quicksilver phase was already over, the lake was at the brass stage.

I chatted on, 'what I like most about Lake Geneva&#x2014;' She heard neither my small talk nor my effort to pass beyond it to a genuine conversation: 'Talk him out it!' she begged again, just as excited ps before. 'How do you imagine I could do it?' she protested with a violence that was also directed against me and which she toned down by adding in a gentler voice: it's impossible, believe me. Impossible.' And soon afterwards: 'Of course, he can't know,'&#x2014;'What can't he know?'&#x2014;'Don't ask,' she begged, pulling herself together and taking another cigarette. I clicked my lighter. 'I shouldn't smoke all the time,' she remarked as though frightened or something, as though I were forcing her, in any case without thanking me for the light, which she did not use. 'He can't know,' she said to herself, 'I've been to see the doctor&#x2014;' I'm sure Frau Julika did not intend to talk to anyone about it and was sorry she had started: naturally I waited to <!--leaf355:

'I don't want him to know yet. It's got to be done. As soon as possible.' Her sudden calm, a kind of composure that made me think the unhappy woman had no idea what it was all about, although she herself subsequently employed the medical expression, which she had learnt not from her doctor, but from her own common sense; her lack of complaint amazed me, so that I stared at the ground, as though searching for something in the gravel, and dared not look her in the face for fear of showing by my expression what I could not help thinking. 'Yes,' she said drily, 'that's the way it is.' I assumed the same dry tone. 'When is the operation to be?' I asked. 'I don't know yet. As soon as I am no longer afraid.'</p>
<p>A moment later Stiller arrived with the other bottle. He was just going up to Glion, he said, to fetch some grapes...</p>
<p>'Talk him out of it!' repeated Frau Julika, as though the ballet school idea was still the topic of conversation. She was lying back with her head cushioned in her girlish hair again. I don't think I've seen a lonelier person than this woman. Between her suffering and the world there seemed to be an impenetrable wall, not merely detachment but rather a kind of certainty she would not be heard, an old and hopeless, absolutely indelible conviction derived from experience, unreproachful but incurable, that her partner could hear only himself. I wanted to ask whether she had never been loved in her life. Of course I didn't ask. And did she herself love? I involuntarily tried to picture her as a child. Was it due to the fact that she was an orphan? Expecting every minute that Frau Julika would begin to pour her heart out, I too remained silent, listening to her regular, muffled breathing. What had happened to this woman? I found it impossible to believe that any human being could have been like this from the outset, so completely unable to express herself even at a moment of agonizing misery. Who had made her like this? Stiller had been gone a quarter of an hour already, in another quarter of an hour he would be back. 'Are you too waiting for me to say something now?' she began at last. 'I've nothing to say. How can I change? I am as I am. Why does Stiller always want to change me?'&#x2014;'Does he want to?'&#x2014;'I know,' she said, 'he probably means well, and he is convinced <!--leaf356:

I asked, 'do you love him too?'&#x2014;'I understand him less and less,' she replied after painful thought. 'Do you know what he's always wanting me to do, Rolf?'...</p>
<p>After this, to take my mind off what she had said, but of course without being able to forget her horrifying revelation, I tried to put into words my current ideas about Stiller, about his human disposition, his actual make-up and his potentialities, his development during the last few years as I had sensed it. I tried to express myself in a way that neither blamed nor defended and scarcely excused, and for a long time I was under the impression that Frau Julika was listening to me. Certainly, I found it easier to 'understand' Stiller than Frau Julika, and after her last question I felt that in any case this was my task for the moment. As I spoke I drew with a twig in the gravel. When I glanced up to try at least to read from her expression her opinion about an idea, a question, which I as a man could not decide, I saw an utterly distorted face. I shall never forget this face that was no longer a face. Her mouth was open as in antique masks. She was trying in vain to bite her lips. Her mouth remained open as though paralysed, trembling. I saw her sobs, but it was as though I was deaf. Her eyes were open, but unseeing, blurred by silent tears, her two little fists in her lap, her body shaking&#x2014;there she sat, unrecognizable, beyond the reach of any cry, with no personal characteristic left, no voice, nothing but a despairing body, flesh screaming soundlessly in the terror of death. I can't remember what I did...</p>
<p>Later, when I held her two little fists that were still trembling convulsively, while her face had grown calm with exhaustion, she said: 'You mustn't tell him.' I nodded in order to give her some sort of feeling of support. 'Promise me!' she begged.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards Stiller arrived with his grapes. Frau Julika rose quickly to her feet with head averted; from the distance she said something about sweets and was gone. Stiller absolutely insisted on my trying the grapes, which were for dessert. Whether he really saw no signs of what I had been through, or only acted as though he didn't, I could not decide. Stiller said how glad he was I had come and promised himself a jolly evening. I steered the conversation on to the subject of the wine <!--leaf357:

I had the irritating feeling that it wasn't the same person at all; as though I had merely dreamed of this woman. It really was growing cool, and we went indoors.

<break type="graphic"/>
<p align="left">At that time I had not yet read the foregoing notes, though I knew that Stiller had written something like a diary in custody. It is not my purpose in the postscript to rectify Stiller's statements. The mischievous element in Stiller's notes, his subjectivity which occasionally did not shrink from falsification, seem to me obvious enough, as the report of a subjective experience they may be honest. The picture which these notes give of Frau Julika amazes me; it appears to me to reveal more about the person who drew the picture than about the person who is so grossly misrepresented by it. Whether there is not something inhuman in the very attempt to portray a living human being is a major question, and one that applies substantially to Stiller. Most of us do not keep notebooks, but perhaps we do the same thing in a less manifest way, and the result is in every case bitter.</p>
<p>My visit to Glion naturally exercised my mind for a long time. Soon after my return I received a letter from Frau Julika in which, without giving any reason, she once more adjured me to say nothing. Whatever might be my own opinion, I had no right to break from without this silence between a couple, unasked, merely because I happened to have come into possession of the facts by chance and probably against the will of the person concerned. Did the unhappy Julika fear that Stiller would lose his head and bring about an impossible situation? I don't know. Or had she reason to hope that perhaps the operation would not be necessary after all?</p>
<p>The other thing that occupied my mind was, of course, Stiller <!--leaf358:

 (misre­) page:357 (358) -->himself. Something had happened to Stiller, it seemed to me. The dresome question of whom we took him for had lapsed, so had his fear of being confused with someone else. In his company I felt as though I had been liberated from some hitherto barely conscious constraint; I myself became freer. As long as a person does not accept himself, he will always have this fear of being misunderstood and misconstrued by his environment; he attaches much too much importance to how we see him, and precisely because of his own obtuse fear of being pushed by us into the wrong role, he inevitably makes us obtuse as well. He wants us to set him free; but he doesn't set us free. He doesn't permit us to confuse him with somebody else. Who is misrepresenting whom? On this point much could be said. The self-knowledge that gradually or abruptly alienates a person from his previous life is merely the first step, indispensable but by no means sufficient in itself. How many people we know who come to a halt after this first step, who are satisfied with the melancholy that comes of mere self-knowledge and who make this melancholy look like maturity! Stiller, I believe, had already passed beyond this stage when he first disappeared. He was in the process of taking the second and much more difficult step, of emerging from resigned regret that one is not what one would so much have liked to be and of becoming what one is. Nothing is harder than to accept oneself. Actually only the naive succeed in doing it, and I have so far met few people in my world who could be described as naive in this positive sense. In my view Stiller, when we met him in custody, had already achieved this painful self-acceptance to a pronounced degree. Why did he nonetheless defend himself in such a childish way against his whole environment, against his former companions? I had the good fortune never to have been directly acquainted with that earlier Stiller. This made a sensible relationship much easier: we were meeting for the first time. In spite of all his self-acceptance, in spite of all his will to self-acceptance, there was one thing our friend had failed to achieve, he had not been able to forego recognition by those around him. He felt himself a different man&#x2014;quite rightly, he was a different man from that Stiller as whom people immediately recognized him&#x2014;and he wanted to convince everyone of this: that was the childish thing. But <!--leaf359: 
type:ent
 (t sur­) page:358 (359) -->how can we forego being recognized, at least by those nearest to us, in the reality that we ourselves do not know, but at best can only live? This renunciation of recognition will never become possible without a certitude that our life is directed by a supra-human authority, without at least the passionate hope that such an authority exists. Stiller reached this certitude very late. Had he reached it? After my visit in autumn I gained the impression that he had, although Stiller never mentioned the subject&#x2014;perhaps precisely because he never mentioned it. Stiller himself&#x2014;and this, no doubt, was an essential reason for his silence&#x2014;had absolutely no desire to announce his metamorphosis. His new work did not serve the purpose of expression either; he made plates and cups and bowls, useful things which in my opinion showed a great deal of good taste, but this work was no longer a form of self-portrayal. He was free from the fear of not being recognized, and in consequence one felt freer in one's attitude to him, as though released from a spell. Now I could understand why, in spite of all my friendly feelings towards him, I had always felt rather afraid of meeting Stiller. The word 'silence' may be misleading. Naturally, Stiller was by no means untalkative. But like everyone who has arrived at himself, he looked at people and things outside himself, and what surrounded him was beginning to be world, something other than projections of his self, which he no longer had to seek or conceal in the world. He himself was beginning to be in the world. That was my impression after my first visit to Glion, and incidentally it was confirmed by his letters, in so far as they did not concern Fraujulika.</p>
<p>Things were, understandably, most difficult in relation to Fraujulika, his wife from before; with her he had the greatest temptation to relapse into old fears and destructive perplexities, to be at a less advanced level of development than he really was in relation to other people. A shared past is no small matter; the habituation that springs up whenever our energy is naturally at a low ebb, the habits that present themselves at every stop, can be diabolical. They are like water-weeds to a swimmer&#x2014;who doesn't know that? On the other hand, I believe, our friend was now aware of the impossibility of flight: it was no use starting a new life by simply leaving the old one behind. Was not Stiller's <!--leaf360:

Otherwise this new present would never become quite real. That's what it was all about&#x2014;to realize potentialities or suffer failure, to breathe or suffocate, in this sense to live or die; more accurately, to live or waste away. Naturally, the relationship with a woman, in the sense of marriage, need not always become this ultimate touchstone; in this case it had become so. There are all kinds of touchstones: Stiller had found his. Our hope, as I have already mentioned, was based on our own happy experience that Stiller, at least in his dealings with his friends, had attained a living, fearless, not merely willed but real and natural openness, that the further he penetrated into himself the more he was able to pay heed to people and things outside himself. These he loved or hated. Caux, for example, he hated wholeheartedly and intolerantly, and boundlessly. Stiller remained a man of temperament, a turbulent spirit; there was no gentle universal love in our friend, but more love than ever before in his life, I believe, and it was to be hoped that this love would also reach Frau Julika, who had such need of it.</p>
<p>The winter passed without another meeting. Naturally I waited from letter to letter to hear that the operation was imminent or perhaps even happily over. I interpreted every remark I could not understand ('P.S. How does one behave under a curse?') as meaning that our friend was now also informed. But the very next letter proved me wrong, since he barely replied to my inquiry after Julika's state of health, or said itwas excellent. Meanwhile it was already February. The dreaded operation seemed to have been unnecessary after all, and in my relief I was merely surprised that Frau Julika, knowing my concern, had never written about it. But that was her way. At one point the seven notebooks he had filled in custody arrived. 'Here are my papers' was the only comment Stiller made in his letter. Why he had sent these notebooks, which I never expected to receive, was not clear to me. Did he want them out of the house so as not to be haunted by their ghost? After reading bits of them, I hoped more than ever that Stiller would at last be able to advance to a condition of living reality also in his <!--leaf361:

It was a rainy day, mist hung over Lake Geneva; we sat in our raincoats on the wet balustrade, doing our best to convince one another that there was nothing to worry about. The wet and hence especially shiny garden gnomes, the house with its ivy and the brick turret, the rusty iron fence, the fake marble tablet bearing the inscription, of which the letters had mostly fallen out, the wet and consequently blackish moss and the cracked fountain - everything was still there and totally unchanged, but in the absence of sunshine extremely lugubrious. We tried to cheer ourselves up by crack­ing jokes, but with no success. The red funicular railway was empty. After an hour dusk began to fall; the State Railway ran along the floor of the valley with its lights on, the hotels of Montreux were ablaze with light, around us was nothing but grey, and no light went on in our friend's house. Drops of water were dripping from the trees. 'Let's go to a hotel,' I suggested, 'and ring up later.' My wife was undecided. 'Now that we've waited so long ...' she suggested. So we smoked one more cigarette. The lights of Montreux, although they did not stand up to the comparison, reminded us of the shimmering )

For a while, as I walked round the chalet and shouted from every side, I had the feeling that Stiller and his wife were no longer there, no longer in Glion, no longer on the earth, that they had vanished, leaving behind them this nauseating example of architectural bad taste that had never belonged to them. The glass door of the underground chamber was not locked, but there was no one in the pottery. Nevertheless there were signs of recent work here: a once blue, now washed-out apron lay on the table as though flung down in haste, a lump of damp clay stood on the wheel. We decided to wait. It was a rainy day, mist hung over Lake Geneva; we sat in our raincoats on the wet balustrade, doing our best to convince one another that there was nothing to worry about. The wet and hence especially shiny garden gnomes, the house with its ivy and the brick turret, the rusty iron fence, the fake marble tablet bearing the inscription, of which the letters had mostly fallen out, the wet and consequently blackish moss and the cracked fountain&#x2014;everything was still there and totally unchanged, but in the absence of sunshine extremely lugubrious. We tried to cheer ourselves up by cracking jokes, but with no success. The red funicular railway was empty. After an hour dusk began to fall; the State Railway ran along the floor of the valley with its lights on, the hotels of Montreux were ablaze with light, around us was nothing but grey, and no light went on in our friend's house. Drops of water were dripping from the trees. 'Let's go to a hotel,' I suggested, 'and ring up later.' My wife was undecided. 'Now that we've waited so long...' she suggested. So we smoked one more cigarette. The lights of Montreux, although they did not stand up to the comparison, reminded us of the shimmering <!--leaf362:

Stiller arrived without coat or hat and apologized for not having pinned a note on the door - he had actually forgotten all about us. He had just come from the Val Mont Hospital; Frau Julika had been operated on that morning. He addressed his not very clear explanations primarily to my wife, who sat on the balustrade as though paralysed, her hands in the pockets of her raincoat. It was now raining as well. Stiller, full of timid trust in the doctor's statement, reported that the opera­tion had been successful, very successful indeed, as successful as it possibly could be.

She had driven our car, and Stiller believed her when she said she was tired. Alone with me, from about nine o'clock on, he seemed to have no desire to speak of the crucial matter or of Frau Julika at all. We discovered that we had both played chess and wanted to find out whether we could still manage it. I couldn't remember where the castles and bishops went. He showed me. Even Stiller had forgotten which way round the board was supposed to go, whether there should be a white or a black square on the right-hand side. But we played. It was a kind of vigil. We played until four in the morning, when the darkness outside the window slowly turned to grey. A fine Easter day seemed to be breaking; the sky was starry. Stiller took it as a sign.</p>
<p>Frau Julika survived the night, all things considered she got through it excellently in fact, and our friend came back from the hospital like a man reprieved; we breathed a sigh of relief. On top of that it was a sunny morning and Easter; Stiller suggested we should go for a walk with him. 'She recognized me!' he said. I have never seen our friend so happy. We strolled along the riverside promenade to Chillon, my wife in between us. Stiller was very talkative in an absent-minded way, all sorts of things occurred to him in confusion&#x2014;his brother's last visit, jokes, then he talked enthusiastically about new friends in Lausanne, about a book-seller and his girl-friend, the world was full of nice people. At intervals he fell very silent, and also deaf. On the sun-warmed stones of the railway embankment we watched the wriggling love-play of two lizards. I asked our friend what he had against Chillon Castle, which he had always referred to scornfully in his letters, not against the hackneyed little pictures on chocolates and musical boxes, but against the reality before our eyes. He had nothing against it, and we found Chillon Castle with its walls lit by the morning sunshine very beautiful. Stiller didn't even notice that I had been teasing him a little about his former disparagement of every thing to do with this country. (As regards this disparagement, which vexed me when I first read his notebooks&#x2014;probably unjustly, since he never expressed himself in these terms to me&#x2014;it is clear that once our friend accepted himself he had no further reason for playing the foreigner; he accepted the fact of being Swiss.) It was a hazy blue <!--leaf364: page:363 (364) -->March day, the nearby Valais mountains appeared quite thin and light and silvery grey. 'How are your children?' he inquired. Rather ostentatiously, he always addressed me, never my wife, although she was walking between us. We lunched at the Hotel du Port, Villeneuve&#x2014;fish washed down with wine from the nearby slopes. As was natural, at the back of his mind he was thinking almost incessantly of Frau Julika. I believe that from the hotel you can see the Val Mont Hospital. Between the soup and the main course, he rang up. 'She's sleeping,' he reported. Only Stiller remained completely clear in the head after the exquisite, but not exactly light white wine. Stiller had been drinking pretty regularly during the last few years.</p>
<p>The only sign here that it was Easter, once the morning bells of the churches had fallen silent, was an excessive quantity of traffic on the main road. We wandered into the Rh&#xF4;ne delta, rather dazzled by the sun and muzzy from the wine. Fishing nets were hanging up to dry. Fishing skiffs lay bottom up on the riverbank waiting for a fresh coat of paint; others were floating in a canal surrounded by swans. 'On a working day you're quite alone here,' said Stiller, but even today there weren't many people about. Our path led through sparse woodland beside the reed beds. There were clumps of alders, birches, beeches, and here and there an oak; all the trees were still bare and so we could see a great deal of airy blue at the time. The ground was covered with the grey autumn leaves of the previous year, not yet hidden by any green growth, and in places the earth was almost black, a bog. I recollect this walk as one of the most enjoyable I ever went for. On the right, away over the dun-coloured reeds, we could see Lake Geneva; on the left the other blue of the equally broad, flat valley of the Rh&#xF4;ne enclosed by precipitous mountains. Unusually large flocks of birds were gathering on a distant high-tension cable; we could not make out the species, but in any case they were gathering for their great flight northwards. Two lads in blue track trousers and stripped to the waist were burning reeds on a pile that gave off bright, transparent flames. The smoke recalled autumn, yet it was March and the birds were twittering. I regretted now that my head was heavy with wine, for a long time I walked along as though under a veil, and Stiller kept asking questions. He <!--leaf365:

 (inquired about my work and my views on education. We found an utterly deserted spot on the riverbank, though it was really quite noisy: a hum of distant trains came to us over the water, we kept hearing the signals from a railway station, and all the time gurgling, rustling, whispering sounds came from among the reeds, birds cried and beat the smooth water with their wings as they they took off. The sun made us very warm, the soil, on the other hand, proved damp and cold. Stiller tore up the dry reeds in bundles to make a comfortable place for my wife to sit. He did not stop even when I offered him one of his favourite cigars, and finally it became a veritable nest; my wife gave his work the praise it deserved, lowered herself on to the dry reeds, and shut her eyes against the sun. Stiller stroked her brow with his hand. At moments like this, which were rare, I became very conscious of the past; then the present shared by the three of us astounded me, seeming impossible, or at least unexpected. So we smoked our cigars. Unfortunately the obtrusive hotel up at Caux was again visible from here, and Stiller couldn't help launching out on the subject once more. His standpoint: 'They work miracles up there, no doubt about it, they produce Christianity not with the poor, but with the rich, where it apparently pays better, and they really manage to fix it so that one of those bandits, after he's collected sufficient swag, repents and spends two, three, four, or nine million for the peace of his soul, or at least so that a better ideology can quickly be opposed to Communism; he only keeps one single million for himself so that he shan't be a burden to the community in his old age. I can't stand that sort of Christianity, Seven millions are better than nothing, they say, and it's all given back in such a voluntary and human way, you know, so that the workers of the world, if they have any tact at all, can never take action against a bandit, for the possibility that one of these capitalist bandits may suddenly repent and improve the world from the centre outwards has been proved once and for all in that hotel up there - so please, if you want a better world, no revolutions please!'

He drank hurriedly in little sips from the slender Vaudois white-wine glasses and remained more awake than we. But we could see he wasn't listening to anything we said. His eyes seemed close to tears. Even when I tried to talk about Frau Julika, he didn't listen. It was all a great strain. Perhaps if he had been alone with either of us, my wife or me, he would have felt like talking. But there we sat, the three of us, and all we could produce was a rather cheap attempt at gaiety, to which Stiller contributed more than we did. After an hour of relative conviviality, we said good night and went up to our room in the turret. Stiller remained standing in the hall down below&#x2014;just as after his nightly telephone calls, without any salutation at the end, not even in response to our repeated 'good nights'; I thought it shocking bad manners, a sentimental kind of coercion, the way he stood there without a word until I broke off, either by replacing the receiver or by shutting the door ... Despite our fatigue, my wife and I could not sleep.</p>
<p>Around one o'clock I got up again. The light was out in the hall, but not in the living-room, and I went downstairs just as I was, in pyjamas and bare-foot, hence almost soundlessly. Our friend was sitting in front of the cold fireplace and seemed to have fallen asleep. I went over, intending to cover him up with something. But his eyes were open. 'Why aren't you asleep?' he said, and his voice was thick. Stiller was now very drunk. 'There's no point in drinking any more...' I said. He filled his glass again as though in defiance and looked me up and down. I said all sorts of sensible things. Stiller drained his glass, and as he rose to his feet he staggered visibly. 'Childish,' he said, 'I've drunk too much, I know it's in bad taste, disgusting, childish...' He shook his head and glanced round as though he had lost something, supporting himself on the back of a chair. 'Is she going to die?' he asked, without looking at me. I tried to calm him, but he didn't hear a word I said: he had picked up the fire tongs and didn't know what to do with them. His eyes were swimming in tears, which didn't impress me, in view of his drunkenness. 'Come,' I said, 'let's go to bed.' He looked at me. 'Yesterday afternoon,' he began, 'when I thought she was dying&#x2014;yesterday afternoon...' I waited in vain; he didn't finish the <!--leaf368:

'Too late,' he said laconically. 'What's too late?' I inquired. I was beginning to shiver. 'Everything,' he replied at last. 'Two years, my dear fellow, two years! I've tried, God knows, I've tried&#x2014;' He belched wine. 'Pardon,' he said and fell silent. Perhaps he was less drunk than I had first thought. He had started to say something, I reminded him: 'You've tried&#x2014;?' Now he had to sit down again. 'It doesn't matter,' he said.</p>
<p>I had never seen Stiller in this state and I felt sorry for him in his physical and mental discomfort that was at the same time ridiculous. I didn't know what to do. I felt that my common-sense approach was very shallow, is she going to die?' he asked as though for the first time, his head in his hands; he seemed to be giddy. 'You talked to the doctor yourself,' I replied. 'What did the doctor tell you? Exacdy?' Even when he was sitting down he swayed, without noticing it, nor did he notice that he kept taking hold of the matches by the wrong end; finally he gave it up and sat with an unlit, bent and crushed cigarette in his mouth, it's never too late,' I said, found this a sadly commonplace remark and then couldn't remember what I had really wanted to say. 'Never too late!' he said with a dull laugh. 'Just make a fresh start. And suppose it just can't be done&#x2014;because it's too late?' All of a sudden Stiller seemed to be much more wide awake. 'Rolf,' he said quite clearly, quite firmly, in spite of his thick voice,'&#x2014;I can kill a person, but can't bring her back to life again...' And he evidently imagined that explained everything. He reached for the bottle again, but fortunately it was empty and only a few drops trickled out. 'What,' I inquired, 'what can't be done?' He merely shook his head. 'Do you love her, then?' I asked. 'Do you want to&#x2014;' He shook his head, without having heard me. 'She can't take anything more from me,' he said, 'can't take anything more from me. She says so herself. "Leave me alone," she says, and there you stand. Honest as she is. I don't know what's wrong, Rolf. I never ask. I've ruined that woman...' His fingers were twisting the disintegrating cigarette and trembling, but at least he had started talking. 'I'm driving her mad. I know. I'm always expecting something. A miracle!

I perish ifl can't love, and she&#x2014;' He tore his cigarette in shreds. 'How do you know, Stiller, that she too doesn't&#x2014;' He shook his head. 'Stiller,' I said, 'you're self-righteous.'&#x2014;'Isn't she?'&#x2014;'Her self-righteousness is her own affair,' I commented. He said nothing. 'What do you mean by love?' I asked, but meanwhile Stiller had found another bottle, which nearly filled his glass after all. 'Stop that drinking!' I told him. He drank. 'That's absurd,' he said, 'you're shivering, Rolf, you've got no slippers on ... What do I mean by love?' he mused and tried to drain the empty glass again: 'I can't love on my own, Rolf, I'm not a saint...'</p>
<p>It was really too cold now; I had looked around in vain for a rug or something of the sort, now I crouched down, snatched a newspaper from the low table and bundled it into the fireplace. There were still a few pine logs in the hearth and even a large beech stump. For a while I was occupied...</p>
<p>'What am I to do?' I suddenly heard Stiller at my back. 'What am I to do? What?' He had risen from the chair again and I just caught sight of him drumming with his fists against his forehead. He was chalky white and still unsteady on his legs; but the alcohol seemed to be leaving his brain. His speech was no longer thick. 'Why could I never make contact with that woman? Never. Not for one day, Rolf, not for one hour in all this time. Never! Why was that?' he asked. 'Tell me.'&#x2014;'What did you expect?'&#x2014;'Expect?' he asked back. 'Yes,' I repeated, 'what did you expect, Stiller, two years ago, I mean, when you came here? To live with one another. I'm asking you because I don't know. It seems to me you expected a transformation&#x2014;on her part.'&#x2014;'On my part, too.'&#x2014;'Don't be offended,' I said lighting the fire, 'but that makes me think of novels. Transformation? A person realizes he has wronged somebody, and himself as well, and one day he is prepared to make amends for everything&#x2014;provided the other person is transformed ... Isn't such an expectation a bit cheap, my dear fellow?'&#x2014;'Like everything about me,' I heard him say. I disregarded this and asked: 'What did you really expect?'

'Even in your letters it sometimes seems to me as though you are not talking about love at all, but about tenderness, about well, yes, about Eros in some form or other. Men of our age need that, Stiller, and I think it's wonderful if one has it ... Only,' I added, 'that's not the point here.'</p>
<p>The fire was now crackling cheerfully, and Stiller was leaving all the talking to me, more than I fancied. But now I had started. 'Things don't go right, you said, and that really surprises you? After so many years experience? And then, you say, you've tried? There are times when one might imagine you think yourself a magician who can change this Frau Julika into her opposite. And all the time, it seems to me, that's the only thing you worry about&#x2014;It's hard to put into words. Julika has become your whole life, Stiller, that's a fact. Why did you return from Mexico? Simply because you had come to realize that. What a couple you are ... Bring her to life! That's your old nonsense, Stiller, if you don't mind my saying so&#x2014;your murderous conceit. You your own saviour!' Stiller said nothing. 'Over one point,' I went on after a pause, 'perhaps I understand you only too well. One gives in, one comes back in order to give in, but one never gives in for good and all. For then, who knows, it would be only spineless resignation, no more, a decision to make the best of things prompted by some sort of narrow-minded conventionality ... You tremble, you said, tremble!

<p>Stiller was standing; I was sitting on the stool, my bare feet stretched out to the warming fire; he said nothing. 'You don't imagine,' I said, 'that with a different, perhaps more open woman&#x2014;Sibylle, for example&#x2014;one can get over everything one has in oneself? Or do you imagine that?' As I turned round I only saw his face from below; he was staring over my head into the fire. 'You let me go on telling you a whole lot of stuff you already know,' I finished off.</p>
<p>Stiller wasn't asleep, he was standing with his hands-in his trouser pockets, and his eyes were open, awake, but empty, <!--leaf371:

In the warmth streaming out from the glowing embers I suddenly felt my fatigue again and had to suppress a yawn. 'What's the time?' asked Stiller. It was getting on for two o'clock.'- She waited, you see, and I didn't wait. For her! From our first walk onwards. For her&#x2014;for some sign, for some utterance, for help, for friends, for anything, for a single sign in all these years! I humiliated her, you see, and she didn't humiliate me!...Isn't that so?' he asked. 'Who says so?' I countered. Now he gazed at me with piercing eyes. 'Rolf,' he declared, 'she wants to die!' He only nodded: 'That's the way it is.' He was deaf to everything I produced for the next five to ten minutes by way of contradiction; he only spoke to murmur 'Pardon' when he belched wine!&#x2014;'You'll keep on until one day it will really be too late, Stiller,' I said. 'Are you going to continue bickering even when she's in the hospital?'&#x2014;'I know I'm being ridiculous,' he said. 'You've gone a long way, Stiller, you mustn't make yourself ridiculous. What you said just now, you don't believe yourself. Who ever dies to please or spite someone else? You overestimate your importance. I mean your importance to her. She doesn't need you as you would like to be needed ... Stiller,' I called, as he began to sink into himself once more, feigning drunkenness, 'why are you suddenly afraid she is going to die?'&#x2014;'I overestimate my importance?'&#x2014;'Yes,' I replied. 'This woman never made you her purpose in life. Only you made something of the sort of her, I think, from the beginning. As I've told you already, you set yourself up as her saviour, you wanted to be the one who gave her life and joy. You! That's the way you loved her, I'm sure, to the point of bleeding to death. You wanted her to be your creation. And now you're afraid she might die on you. She didn't become what you expected. An unfinished life's work!...'</p>
<p>Stiller walked over to the window and opened it. 'Are you feeling sick?' I asked. 'Why don't you sit down?' He turned his back to me and wiped his brow with a handkerchief. 'Just go on talking,' he begged. 'I'll get you some water,' I said, putting down the fire tongs ready to stand up. 'Did she write you many letters?' 'Only one,' I replied. 'Why?' He wiped his forehead <!--leaf372: 
type:bold
 (again. 'Doesn't matter,' he said, dismissing the subject, i don't imagine, Stiller, that I understand your wife, that I understand her better than you do. We're almost complete strangers, your wife and I, we've scarcely talked to one another. Her letter was very short, anyhow.' He nodded sadly: 'You understand her. Yes, yes. It's lucky for her.' And then: i feel lousy, you must forgive me.' Nevertheless, Stiller didn't go out and relieve him­self, as I had expected. He was like wax, and every time I saw his eyes I knew that there was actually only one question for him: Is she going to die? He made an effort to think about something else. And to that extent, he was glad someone was talking. 'Weren't you going to say something?' he asked. But I could no longer remember at what point our conversation had been interrupted. Now I remarked casually: 'By the way ... I've read your papers.' - 'Burn them!' - 'What do you hope to gain by burning them?' I replied. 'That's what you wrote them for ... You've striven for this woman, as the saying goes. I understand her perhaps over one single point. Who would ever think of asking his saviour how he was himself? In all those years, you see, she got used to the idea that you didn't want to be a poor, weak man, but her saviour.' Stiller smiled. 'Why don't you say it straight out?' I didn't know what he meant, his vague smile baffled me. When I looked at him he was shaking in every limb; he had the shivers, it's nothing,' he said, 'just this idiotic drinking!' At this I steered him over to the only chair with a high back against which he could rest his head, and shut the window. 'Wouldn't it be better,' I asked, 'if I were to take you up to bed?' He shook his head. I placed the beech stump in the glowing embers. 'What can I do?' he asked from under the hands that supported his face, i can't be born again, Rolf. I don't want to, either ... What have I done wrong? Tell me. I don't know. What have I done? Tell me, I'm an idiot. Tell me!' - i've read your papers,' I repeated, in them you know quite a lot.' He took his hands away from his face, if knowing would do it!' he said and sat for a long time unspeaking, his hands dangling, his elbows resting on his knees. 'Do you remember last autumn,' he asked, 'the evening the three of us spent to­gether? It was nothing special. But everything went smoothly. 37« )

'I don't know,' I said, 'what you mean by guilt. At least you've reached the point of no longer seeking it in other people. But perhaps, I don't know, you think it could have been avoided. Guilt is the sum total of one's own faults that could have been avoided, is that how you mean it? Anyhow, I think guilt is something different. Guilt is ourselves&#x2014;' Stiller broke in: 'Why did I come back? You've never seen anything like it. Sheer lunacy, nothing else, utter pigheadedness! Can't <!--leaf374: page:373 (374) -->you understand? When you've stood half a lifetime knocking at a door, great God, unsuccessfully as I stood before this woman, absolutely without success, great God&#x2014;then see if you can pass on! See if you can forget a door like that, after wasting ten years knocking at it! Give it up and move on!...Where does love come into it? I couldn't forget her. That's all. As one can't forget a defeat. Why did I go back? Out of drunkenness, my dear chap, out of spite. You with your noble views! Go into a casino and just watch the way they go on playing when they lose, the way they keep on sitting there. It's just the same. Because there comes a point when it simply isn't worth while giving up. Out of spite, out of jealousy. Youcan lose a woman when you've won her. Let someone else come along! But when you've never won her yourself, never made contact with her, never fulfilled her? Forget a door like that, let others go in, pass on! You're quite right: Why didn't we separate? Because I'm a coward.'</p>
<p>Stiller tried to laugh. 'You're saying just the same in different words,' I commented, 'only I don't consider it cowardly.'&#x2014;'A sacrifice, you think? A reciprocal sacrifice, in which both perish!'&#x2014;'Of course, there are cases where people can separate,' I said, 'where they ought to separate, and if they don't it's cowardice, inertia. How many there are who I wish would separate, the quicker the better; there are certainly episodes, inside or outside marriage, and when they're over you can finish with them. Not every couple become one another's cross! But when it is like that, when we have made it like that, when it isn't an episode, but the central theme of our lives&#x2014;' Stiller protested: 'Cross!'&#x2014;'Call it what you like.'&#x2014;'Why don't you say it frankly?' he asked. 'You don't say it openly in your letters either.'&#x2014;'What?'&#x2014;'What you mean: His will be done! God has given, and blessed are they who accept, and dead they who cannot hear, like myself, who cannot love in the name of God, the accursed like myself, who hate because they want to love by their own efforts, for God alone is the love and the power and the glory&#x2014;that's what you mean, isn't it?' He didn't look at me, but sat with his head resting against the wooden chair-back and the same vague smile on his face once more. 'And lost are the proud,' he went on, 'those with the murderous pride who seek to bring back to <!--leaf375: page:374 (375) re:comma_no_space (,&lt;/p&gt;) re:period_no_space (e.t) -->life what they have slain, those with the miserly regret, who calculate and lament at a time like this when things take a different course or don't move at all, the deaf and the blind, who hope for mercy at a time like this, the small-minded like myself, those with a childish spite against suffering, yes, let them get drunk, the arrogant who sin against hope, the stubborn, the unbelieving, the greedy, who want to be happy, yes let them get drunk and chatter, those who refuse to be broken in their pride, the unbelieving, those who put their earthly hope in Julika! But blessed are the others, blessed are those who can love in His name, for in God alone ... Is that it?' he asked, is that what you've been trying to say all the time?'&#x2014;i'm your friend,' I answered, i'm trying to tell you what I think about Julika and you, about your loneliness with each other. That's all.'&#x2014;'Well, what do you think then?' he asked, his head against the wooden chair-back. 'I've told you.' Stiller seemed unable to remember. 'You love her,' I repeated. 'That's what you think,' he retorted. 'But you expect from your love something like a miracle, my dear chap, and that is probably what you feel hasn't worked out.'&#x2014;'I love her?'&#x2014;'Yes,' I asserted, 'whether it suits you or not. You would rather have loved someone else. I know. And she knows too! Perhaps Anya, or whatever her name was, your Polish girl in Spain, or Sibylle upstairs ... Only it's not Julika's fault that she isn't the girl you might have made happy.'&#x2014;'No,' he said. 'Julika can't help that either.'&#x2014;'You love without being able to make the creature you love happy. That is your suffering. A real suffering&#x2014;apart from all our vanity, for one would like to play God Almighty a bit, to take the world out of one's pocket, to conjure life on to the table, hey presto! And then, certainly, we should like to be happy ourselves when we love ... That doesn't always happen!' I said, and as he did not smile, I added: 'That's roughly what I think, and if you ask me what you should do&#x2014;' His thoughts were elsewhere. 'Since autumn!' he said, and his lips were trembling. 'She has known since autumn. I found out today from the doctor. Since autumn! And there was I whistling away in my underground chamber with no idea at all, no idea at all ... What am I to do!' he exclaimed, vigorously on the defensive against me.

'Without me.' - 'Why without you?' - 'Her things were all packed. There was another hour to wait. We didn't know what to talk about. Flowers don't help, I know. But I just had to get some. There was nothing she would have liked in Territet. So I went on to Montreux. In forty minutes I was back at the house, in forty minutes - well, she went to the hospital alone.' He forced himself to smile. 'Perhaps you think nothing of it,' he added, 'you with your common sense?' - 'What do you think of it?' - 'Without me!' he answered, 'Without me! That gave her more of a kick than flowers, you see. To leave this house perhaps for the last time, alone, unescorted, oh yes, that lasts longer than all the flowers in the world!' I didn't accept his explanation. 'Rolf,' he retorted, 'that woman is spiteful. Perhaps I made her spiteful. One day, you can't believe in love any more ... I was too late!' Stiller had risen to his feet. He looked as though he would fall down any minute, I didn't know what kept him upright at all. 'Have a white brandy,' he said, 'and then we'll go to bed.' But he couldn't find the glasses, which I could see on a tray lower down, and seemed to forget what he had meant to do. He just stood there, the brandy bottle in his hand, lost in silent thoughts. 'There is no one who is more of a stranger to me than that woman,' he said. 'I don't want to bore you, Rolf, but I must just say this: I shall be grateful, I shan't wait for a miracle.

 (pdf: 5 bx: 1;[looke=looke|he as/|same /|Am I /|what?/]) -->looked at the room, at the two empty armchairs. 'What then?' he asked himself, and a few moments later he addressed the same question to me: 'What then, my dear chap, what then? Am I to dissolve in smoke, so as not to be a nuisance to her? Or what? Shall I fast until she gives a sign, and show her that one can die ofhunger waiting? Or what?'&#x2014;'Stiller,' I replied, 'things won't be as they were before. Things won't be the same for you, even if Julika never changes. Yesterday afternoon you thought she was dying&#x2014;' As soon as he realized what I was leading up to, he broke in. 'I know what you mean,' he said. He showed me he was feeling sick, to stop me from talking, so I said no more. 'How many revelations I've already had, how many decisions I have reached!' he said. 'But what will happen when she is sitting here again? I'm gradually getting to know myself. I'm weak'&#x2014;'Once you know you're weak,' I commented, 'that is already a big step forward. Perhaps you have only just found out. Since yesterday afternoon, when you thought she was dying. Often you hate her, you say? Because she, too, is weak and poor? She can't give you what you need. Quite true. And her love is so necessary to you. More so than any other. There are things which are very necessary, Stiller, and yet we can't manage to do them. Why should Julika be able to manage it? Do you idolize her&#x2014;still&#x2014;or do you love her?' Stiller let me talk. 'Yes, yes,' he said, 'but speaking practically, when she's there and I'm here, what am I to do? Quite practically?' He looked at me. 'You see, Rolf, even you can't answer that!' he said, and it seemed to satisfy him. 'You've gone a long way,' I said, 'I sometimes have the impression that one more step is all you need.'&#x2014;'And we'll be sitting here in the middle of a wedding, you mean?'&#x2014;'And you will no longer expect Julika to be able to absolve you from your life or the other way round. You know what that means in practical terms.'&#x2014;'No.'&#x2014;'There'll be no change,' I said, 'you will live together, you with your work in the underground chamber down there, she with her one lung, God willing. The only difference will be that you won't go on tormenting yourselves day after day with this crazy notion that we can change people, somebody else or ourselves, with this presumptuous despair ... Quite practically&#x2014;you will learn to pray for one another.' Stiller had risen to his feet. 'Yes,' I <!--leaf378: 
type:bold
 (concluded, 'that's really all I can say to you on the subject.' Stiller put the brandy bottle down on the little table, and we looked at each other; the vague smile he had worn before did not reappear. 'One has to know how to pray!' was all he said, and there followed a lengthy silence... Later, much later, I often wondered how I ought to have behaved that night, unexpectedly confronted with a task that went beyond the powers of a friendship. When Stiller left the room to relieve himself at last, I stood there helpless. I felt my lack of any official status, for whatever 1 might have said re­mained merely my personal opinion. At best I could do no more than offer friendly resistance whenever my friend, who was being tested, tried to evade the test... I poured myself out a glass of white brandy, and when Stiller returned about ten minutes later - unfortunately not without bumping into a piece of furniture in the dark hall and causing a clatter - he found me with the empty glass in my hand. 'How do you feel?' I asked. Stiller only nodded. He had emptied his stomach, and obviously also washed his face, which was green with inflamed eyes. 'What time is it?' he inquired afresh, sit­ting down on the clothes press and supporting himself on his outspread arms. 'You're right,' he said, 'this idiotic drinking - !' Stiller seemed to want to forget our unfinished conversation. It seemed that in order to go upstairs to bed all we needed was an appropriate phrase, an optimistic cliche - Tomorrow is another day, or something like that. The clock struck half past two. Of course we both thought of time in the hospital. There time was important, not here. I involuntarily visualized the sick-room, the night nurse sitting by the white bed taking her pulse - let's hope she doesn't have to ring the doctor - and for the first time I felt afraid. I saw the telephone on the clothes press, which might ring at any moment, and felt that the worst was possible. I remembered the doctor's refusal to let Stiller pay Julika an evening visit. 'What are you thinking about?' asked Stiller, and I had to say something. 'All you have to do now is to be sensible, Stiller, not to see ghosts. You love her. You have begun to love her, and Julika isn't dead, everything is still possible ...' I felt slightly ashamed, but this was just the sort of hackneyed phrase that seemed to pacify Stiller.

'One has to know how to pray!' was all he said, and there followed a lengthy silence...</p>
<p>Later, much later, I often wondered how I ought to have behaved that night, unexpectedly confronted with a task that went beyond the powers of a friendship. When Stiller left the room to relieve himself at last, I stood there helpless. I felt my lack of any official status, for whatever I might have said remained merely my personal opinion. At best I could do no more than offer friendly resistance whenever my friend, who was being tested, tried to evade the test...</p>
<p>I poured myself out a glass of white brandy, and when Stiller returned about ten minutes later&#x2014;unfortunately not without bumping into a piece of furniture in the dark hall and causing a clatter&#x2014;he found me with the empty glass in my hand. 'How do you feel?' I asked. Stiller only nodded. He had emptied his stomach, and obviously also washed his face, which was green with inflamed eyes. 'What time is it?' he inquired afresh, sitting down on the clothes press and supporting himself on his outspread arms. 'You're right,' he said, 'this idiotic drinking&#x2014;!' Stiller seemed to want to forget our unfinished conversation. It seemed that in order to go upstairs to bed all we needed was an appropriate phrase, an optimistic clich&#xE9;&#x2014;Tomorrow is another day, or something like that. The clock struck half past two. Of course we both thought of time in the hospital. There time was important, not here. I involuntarily visualized the sick-room, the night nurse sitting by the white bed taking her pulse&#x2014;let's hope she doesn't have to ring the doctor&#x2014;and for the first time I felt afraid. I saw the telephone on the clothes press, which might ring at any moment, and felt that the worst was possible. I remembered the doctor's refusal to let Stiller pay Julika an evening visit. 'What are you thinking about?' asked Stiller, and I had to say something. 'All you have to do now is to be sensible, Stiller, not to see ghosts. You love her. You have begun to love her, and Julika isn't dead, everything is still possible...' I felt slightly ashamed, but this was just the sort of hackneyed phrase that seemed to pacify Stiller. 'Have you got <!--leaf379:

 (pdf: 11 bx: 1;['You ='You |ready/|the f/|proba/|us to/|and c/|outsp/|truth/|two y/|two y/|...' /]) -->another cigarette?' he asked to avoid going to bed and being alone. I was in pyjamas: I had no cigarettes. 'I'm sure your wife won't have been able to sleep,' remarked Stiller, 'I loved your wife&#x2014;I still love her,' he added to get everything straight, 'but you know that.' His silences grew longer and longer. 'Leave them,' he muttered, as I pushed the empty bottles a little to one side, so that Stiller shouldn't fall over them and make a fresh clatter. 'Or do you think I've never loved at all?' he asked uncertainly. 'Never loved at all?' His face was now visibly disintegrating with fatigue, if only I weren't so damned wide awake!' he expostulated and looked as though he were on the point of vomiting. 'You must rest,' I said. 'You'll see her at nine tomorrow morning&#x2014;' His cigarettes, the blue Gauloises, were lying on the carpet by the chair. 'Thanks,' said Stiller when I offered him his own packet, and put a Gauloise in his mouth; but he took it out again, in spite of the lighted match I held out to him. 'I shall see her at nine tomorrow!...' Then he smoked as though the smoke were a food.</p>
<p>'You don't think,' he asked, 'that Julika is going to die?' At this I said something imprudent: 'As long as your telephone doesn't ring, Stiller, there's no reason to fear anything of the sort.' Once it was said it was said, and I could not take back the senseless remark that had given his fear a physical object to which it could attach itself. Stiller looked at the black telephone. So I went on speaking, 'You must be prepared for that,' I said. 'One day Julika, too, will die. Sooner or later. Like the rest of us. You must be prepared for that now.' Stiller smoked and said nothing. I had no idea what he was thinking. At last he threw his cigarette into the fireplace, or at least close to it, ready to bring the conversation to a final close. I was freezing: the fire was going out and there was no more wood. 'It was probably a good thing,' I said, descending to clich&#xE9;s again, 'for us to have had this talk&#x2014;' Stiller nodded without conviction and continued to sit on the clothes press, supported on his outspread arms; he seemed to be waiting for strength. 'The truth is, I'm at exactly the point where I ought to have begun two years ago,' he remarked, 'not a step further. Only another two yean have been lost&#x2014;I don't want to bore you, Rolf, but...' He saw that I was shivering. 'Rolf,' he said, 'everything <!--leaf380:

Without a miracle, believe me, we should have got on all right, the two of us, just as we are&#x2014;not then, but now; I mean two years ago. Now for the first time, here and now...' Stiller didn't want to cry, he fought against it and stood up. This morning in the hospital,' he said,'&#x2014;no, that was yesterday&#x2014;' Tears streamed all over his face, which was in no way that of a man in tears; he tried to say something. 'Everything would have been all right&#x2014;' he repeated, but got no further. 'Then it will be all right!' I said. 'It will be all right!'</p>
<p>What happened next was strange; for a time we both acted as though Stiller was not crying at all. He stood somewhere in the room, his hands in his trouser pockets, unable to speak. I saw his back, not his face, knew that Stiller was crying and because he was crying could hear nothing, and talked about his 'notebooks', simply to avoid being a mute spectator.'&#x2014;anyhow, you know the essential point,' I said among other things, 'you know that nothing is settled by putting a bullet in your temple, for example. How one learns that is something that cannot be described. But you know it, unimaginable as it is. Perhaps you have a queer idea of what it means to believe; perhaps you think one is certain when one believes, so to speak wise and saved and so on. You feel yourself to be anything but certain, so you simply don't believe you're a believer. Isn't that so? You can't picture God, so you tell yourself you have never experienced Him...' Stiller seemed glad I was talking. 'As far as I know your life,' I said, 'you have again and again thrown everything away because you were uncertain. You are not truth. You are a man and you have often been willing to give up an untruth, to be uncertain. What else does that mean, Stiller, but that you believe in a truth? And in a truth that we cannot change and cannot even kill&#x2014;a truth that is life.'</p>
<p>The grandfather clock out in the hall began to clank as it always did before striking the hour; it was three o'clock. 'I got an odd impression from your notebooks,' I went on, for the sake of something else to say. 'You kept trying to accept yourself without accepting anything like God. And now this proves an impossibility. He is the power which can help you really to accept yourself. You've learnt all that. And yet you say you <!--leaf381:

 (can't pray; you write it too. You cling to your powerlessness, which you take for your personality, and yet you know your powerlessness so well - and all this as though out of spite because you are not power. Isn't that so?' Of course Stiller didn't answer. 'You feel it must compel you, otherwise it's not genuine. You don't want to kid yourself. You're annoyed because you have to beg for belief; then you're afraid God might simply be your own invention...' I went on talking for a long time before finally coming to a stop. As I have said, I did not expect Stiller to listen: I only talked to avoid being a mute spectator of his weeping. His thoughts were elsewhere. 'Her face,' said Stiller, 'that isn't her face at all, it never was - !' He was unable to express himself any further. Stiller was now crying as I have rarely seen a man cry. And all the time he stood there with his hands in his trouser pockets. I didn't leave the room; my presence no longer carried any weight... During those minutes I made a great effort to recall her face, but only saw it as it was last autumn, when it was no longer a face at all; I saw her sobbing with her mouth wide open and rigid, her equally rigid fists in her lap, the dumb trembling of a blind body filled with the fear of death; but I didn't want to be reminded of that now. I resolved to go to the hospital myself the following morning, to see Frau Julika, if only for a moment. 'Say something,' begged Stiller when, finally exhausted by his crying, he became aware of my presence again, i've said all I can say to you: Julika hasn't died,' I repeated, 'and you love her.' At this Stiller looked at me as though I had uttered a revelation. His legs were still unsteady, his eyes watery, but his head was sober, I believe.

I should say they are glittering, somehow watery, even when she is not crying, bluish-green like the edges of colourless window-glass. Unfortunately her eyebrows have been plucked to a thin line, which gives her face a graceful hardness, but also a slightly masklike appearance, as though perpetually miming surprise. Her nose looks very aristocratic, especially from the side; there is a great deal of involuntary expression in the nostrils. Her lips are rather thin for my taste, not without sensuality, but they must first be aroused. Her loose hair is gloriously silky and as light as gossamer. Her front teeth are splendid, not without fillings, but otherwise gleaming like mother of pearl. I looked at her as though she were an object; as though she were just any unknown woman...' That was exactly how she lay on the deathbed, and I suddenly had the monstrous feeling that from the very beginning Stiller had only seen her as a dead woman; for the first time, too, I felt the deep unqualified consciousness of his sin, a consciousness no human word would obliterate.</p>
<p>The only thing left was to bring the heavy tidings to my friend. A few words were enough; Stiller already knew. Although almost an hour had passed since I left the hospital, they had not telephoned; but he knew the moment he saw me, and I believe Stiller uttered my news himself; I won't say 'calmly', for it was the terrifying calm of someone whose mind is wandering. I waited a long time to drive Stiller to the hospital. He went up to his room, to fetch his coat, so he said. We heard nothing, no footsteps, no sobs, only the noise of the birds outside, and after a time my wife was manifestly afraid our friend might have done something to himself. I didn't believe this for an instant, but as he still didn't come I went upstairs and knocked at his door. There was no answer, so I went in. Stiller was standing in the middle of the room, his hands in his trouser pockets as so often. 'I'm coming,' he said. I drove him to the hospital and waited outside in the car. The picture of the dead woman was so much stronger than anything I could see with open eyes&#x2014;the picture of a being who was dead and had never been recognized by anyone while she was alive, least of all by the one who had striven for her with his human love.
